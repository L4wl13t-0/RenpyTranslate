You do not have any Action Points remaining.
OK Rachel. Lets have you up against the whiteboard over here so we can take your picture.
Miss Newman, on the white board please write Rachel's name, age and the reason she is being punished.
Um, what's going on?
I am taking your picture Rachel.
My picture?! I don't like having my picture taken.
This isn't optional.
Why do you need my picture?
I am recording your punishment for the school's owners.
The school's owners?!
This is a privately owned institution. The school's owners take a great interest in your education.
They want to know what you look like and they want to know that you are being properly disciplined.
Now hands up above your head, feet apart. Let's get a good look at you.
OK, Rachel hands up above your head. I'm going to take your picture again for the school's owners.
Yes sir.
Good. Now for a close up of your face.
Very good. Now turn around.
Excellent. OK Rachel, that's enough for now. Come back and stand over by my desk.
