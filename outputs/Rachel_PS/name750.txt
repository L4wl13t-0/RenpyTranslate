I think so too.
I'm sorry Rachel to have to embarrass you like this.
Please don't be too upset this is just another important lesson for you.
For although you need to become more confident, you must also remember to remain humble.
Yes sir.
Should I put my shirt back on sir?
No. I think the punishment will be more effective if you remain as you are.
Hmmmm... If you think it will help?
I really do.
Also with Rachel's breasts exposed this will be a good time for you to learn some new punishment techniques.
I'm always keen to learn, sir.
Excellent.
Two new actions have been unlocked for the hands on head position. Use them to apply pleasure and pain to Rachel's nipples.
Yes sir.
Miss Newman if you wouldn't mind taking off your shirt and bra to make sure the girl feels suitably embarrassed.
No problem sir.
Oh no.
There is no point ordering Rachel to be bottomless when she doesn't wear a bra anyway.
Rachel, in accordance with the school's rules you are to remove your skirt and blouse then lower your underwear.
But then I'll be naked...
Yes. I'm afraid so.
Miss Newman if you also wouldn't mind taking off your shirt and bra to make sure the girl feels suitably embarrassed.
No problem sir.
Rachel you are to remove all clothing as per the new school rules.
Yes sir.
Miss Newman if you wouldn't mind taking off your shirt and bra to make sure the girl feels suitably embarrassed.
No problem sir.
OK Rachel, you know the drill. Hands above your head, put your feet apart.
Yes sir.
Hands above your head, put your feet apart.
Yes sir.
Hands above your head feet apart Rachel.
But...
What's the matter? Scared to let us see your little breasts in comparison to your teacher's?
Yes...
I'm afraid you have no choice.
There, that wasn't so hard was it?
Hands above your head, feet apart Rachel.
Yes sir.
Well done Rachel. It's good to see that you are learning to follow my instructions.
Hands above your head, feet apart.
Yes sir...
Well done Rachel. It's good to see that you are finally learning to follow my instructions.
Rachel you are to lay yourself across Miss Newman's lap.
Oh gosh.
Let me know what you'd like me to do next sir.
Oh gosh.
Let me know what you'd like me to do next sir.
Yes Mr [surname].
Let me know what you'd like me to do next sir.
