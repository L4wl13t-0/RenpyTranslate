Wow, so you really think it will help?
I do.
So how does it work?
Well, this confidence building exercise works by you pretending you are your favourite animal.
Huh?
As you have already told me your favourite animal is a cat. I want you to pretend that you are a cute little cat.
I can't do that. I'd feel silly.
Do cats ever feel silly Rachel? Do they spend long periods obsessing over what other people think about them?
No.
Do they ever worry about their appearance?
No sir! Cats are totally body confident!
Ha! I suppose that's true. Wouldn't you like to be like that Rachel?
Yes!
Well then, now you understand the point of the exercise.
Here take these cat ears.
Oh cool, these are just like the ones my computer game character has. They are the same colour and everything.
How do I look?
Very cute.
Um, I don't really know what I'm supposed to do though.
Whatever you want Rachel. That's what's great about being a cat isn't it?
You want to curl up on the sofa and take a nap? I won't stop you.
You want me to stroke you behind your ears? I will do so.
As long as you stay in character then I will let you do whatever you want.
So do you want to play this game?
Um... Yes.
I mean... Meow.
Oh my. A kitten has wandered into my office. Hello little kitty what are you doing here?
Meow.
Hehe.
Such an adorable little animal.
Oh, you're a friendly little kitty aren't you?
Purr purr...
Wait where are you going now?
Are you exploring the office?
Meow.
Oh hey now kitty, my desk is not for playing around on.
Meow.
Hey, now what are you up to?
Meow.
Uh! What a naughty kitten you are!
Hehe.
You are too cute to be mad with though.
Meow.
What to do with you with you?
I have some string here kitty, would you like to play with it?
Meow.
Meow.
You like that do you?
Meow.
Aw, such a cute kitty.
