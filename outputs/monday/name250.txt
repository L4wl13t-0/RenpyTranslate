The swimming pool seems to still be under construction. I'll need to save up to repair it.
Good afternoon girls.
Good afternoon sir.
Are you joining the sports lesson?
No sir, we just had a class with Miss Newman. We need to head to maths class now.
No problem girls, don't let me keep you.
It's school hours so the girls are all in lessons.
This is where the staff live. It's school hours so they'll all be at work. I should come back here another time.
Spend the afternoon teaching a class?
Good afternoon Alice.
Hi headmaster.
How are you doing? You mentioned before that you were having trouble with your studies?
Yes sir. I failed my exams last year and I'm worried it might happen again.
I'm just not very smart. Do you think you could tutor me?
Of course! Come to my office. I'm always glad of a distraction when I'm doing paperwork.
Amazing! Thank you so much. I'll see you in your office.

Hello Alice.
Hello Headmaster.
I need to inspect your uniform Alice.
Oh, sure.
Lift your skirt please.
My skirt?!
Yes.
Why do I need to lift my skirt?
Alice, all students must comply with a uniform inspection when asked by a teacher. That includes underwear.
This is school policy agreed by the school board.
A bulletin was sent out to all the students. Did you not read it?
Um... No.
Well you should really pay more attention to the school bulletins Alice.
No lift up your skirt and show me your underwear.
Yes sir.
Those are not regulation underwear Alice.
Sir, I didn't know anyone was going to be checking them!
Ignorance is no excuse for disobeying the rules young lady.
I'm afraid Alice I'm going to have to confiscate those.
Confiscate them?!
Yes. Good God girl, you really need to keep up with the school bulletins. Any clothing in breach of the uniform policy may be immediately confiscated.
Come on hand them over.
Yes sir.
Let me just...
OK, here you go.
What are these?
My knickers! I just handed them to you.
Really? They look different from the ones I saw a moment ago. Are you trying to play a trick on me?
What? No sir.
Are you trying to fob me off by giving me a pair you had in your pocket?
These skirts don't have pockets sir.
A likely story. Well, there's only one way to check. Skirt back please.
But sir, I really did take my knickers off.
