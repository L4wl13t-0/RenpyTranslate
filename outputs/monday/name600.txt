Good evening headmaster I'm Maria Consuelo. I'm in charge of overnight security.
Nice to meet you Maria.
How are the girls behaving themselves this evening?
The girls seem pretty quiet at the moment.
I'm glad to hear it. I'll let you get back to work.
Stop there please. Men are not allowed to enter the bedroom area.
Right, yes. Of course.
Should I sneak around back and check up the girls behaviour?
