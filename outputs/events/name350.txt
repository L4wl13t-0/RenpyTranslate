The girls notice you looking up their skirts.
They all run off. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} -1.
Whilst patrolling the halls you find Debbie bullying Lucy.
How should you respond?
Debbie Harris. What do you think you're playing at?
What? Nothing.
I saw you shove Lucy up against the locker.
Report to my office after school. I'll deal with you then.
Now all of you, get going to lessons.
You're a little snitch Lucy and I'm going to teach you a lesson. Turn around.
Oooofff.
You shouldn't have ratted me out to the headmaster.
Debbie stop it. What are you doing?
Ouch!!!
Now get in your locker and think about what you've done.
Wait Debbie...
Come on Cass.
Wow, that was pretty harsh. I'd better check that Lucy is OK.
Hello, is anybody out there...
Lucy?
Oh hello headmaster. I seem to have fallen into my locker could you help me out?
Sure thing.
Oh my. Are you OK in there Lucy?
Um, yeah. I'm fine.
Who did this to you, was it Debbie?
Um, no. I just fell.
You fell into that position?
Yes sir.
Hmmm... I can't reveal I watched the whole thing and did nothing. I guess Debbie will get away it.
Oh well, lets get you out of there.
Are you sure you're OK Lucy? Let me take you to the nurse's office.
Thank you sir but I'm fine. I'll just get going.
Lucy was grateful for you rescuing her from the locker but Debbie got away with her bad behaviour. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +1 {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} -2.
Hi girls, what are you up to?
Hello headmaster. We're working on a project Miss Chang set us.
Fantastic. It's good to see you girls working hard.
Well don't let me stop you studying, see you later girls.
Girls" "Bye sir.
Girls" "
You leave the girls to work on their project {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +1.
Well since there are so many of you in the same place it will be a good time to perform a uniform inspection.
Stand up and lift your skirts.
What really?!
Yes. You should know the rules by now. Stand up.
Now lift those skirts and keep them up until I have a chance to inspect your underwear.
The girls obediently lift their skirts realising that they have no choice but to obey your rules. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +1. However, you interrupted their study session and their {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} have not improved.
A girl is sat on her own crying. What do you do?
Girls cry all the time. This is hardly your concern.
You sit with the girl and try to comfort her.
She feels a little better. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +1.
