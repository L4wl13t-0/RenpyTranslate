What happened then Miss Star?
Hmmm... I'm not sure Trixie should be telling inappropriate stories to girls. Should I stop her?

Oh sir, she was just getting to the good bit.
Sorry girls, off you go now.
The girls were upset you interrupted the story. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} -1.
You know what, she did it anyway and she got more tips that night than the rest of the week put together.
With the money she made she was able to pay my mom's bail and that's how my grandma saved Christmas.
Wow.
Trixie's stories are hardly a good example for the girls. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} -1.
Whilst patrolling the grounds you find Anna talking to some of the girls outside of Miss Chang's chemistry class.
No Maxine that's an ionic bond, a covalent bond is where electrons are shared between atoms.
Oh right that makes sense.
Wow Miss Dixon, you're so clever.
Thank you dear.
It's good for the girls to have a positive role model to look up to. Grades and discipline improve as a result.
