Of course you are. How about you Priti?
I'm Aphrodite. Goddess of beauty.
Perfect. You both look adorable.
Err... Actually I look very powerful and imposing.
Right. Yes. Sorry Donna.
Well, I'll leave you both to it.
Stupid top, I can't get into it. Pull harder!
I'm pulling as hard as I can Alice. Your boobs are way too big I can't close it.
We're just going to have to find another costume for you.
But I want to be Athena! It's not fair!
It fit me last time we tried! Just pull really hard.
OK I'll try. I don't think this will get any tighter.
Grrr..
Oh no!
Oh my gosh! I'm sorry Alice
Let me try and fix it!
Maxine!
Just hold still I can't get it back in place.
Just get off my boobs Maxine!
Having some trouble with Alice's costume?
Headmaster!
Oh no. Look away sir!
Oh my God Maxine, stop touching my boobs!
I'm sorry Alice. Come on. Let's look backstage and see if we can find another costume for you.
So unfair!
Hi girls.
Hello Headmaster.
Who are you two supposed to be?
I'm Herdone the goddess of pleasure. Daughter of Cupid and Psyche.
And I'm Altos. The god of pain!
Err... actually Louise, I'm pretty sure he or she was called Algea or Algos. Not Altos.
Whatever, I'm a god Mary. I'll call myself whatever I like. Altos has a better ring to it.
You can't just change the letters! We're obscure enough gods as it is.
I can and I will!
Pleasure and pain, huh? A good combination. OK girls well you carry on practising your lines.
I can't wait to see you all in this play.
Bye sir.
Hello Claire.
Hello headmaster.
How are the rehearsals going?
Not great to be honest with you. We only get to practice once a week and the girls don't seem interested in learning their lines.
I think they all just enjoy dressing up.
When is the play due to be performed?
We haven't set a date yet. We have a lot of rehearsing left to do.
What made you choose to do a play about Greek mythology?
To be entirely honest with you, I just tried to come up with something that fit with the random collection of costumes in the stores here.
It was a real struggle.
Oh well, the girls look great. You've done a good job.
Thank you. You're very kind to say so.
Well keep practising. I'm looking forward to the performance.
