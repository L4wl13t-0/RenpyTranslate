I'll give you a warning this time Rachel. Don't let me see you sleeping in class again.
Yes sir, thank you sir!
You decide to let it slide this one time. The girls appreciate you being lenient {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} + 1. However, this sets a very bad example {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} -1.
Rachel!
Oh my gosh!
Am I boring you? Falling asleep in class is a punishable offence. Report to my office after school.

Rachel!
Oh my gosh!
Rachel, am I boring you?
Um, no sir.
I warned you about paying attention in class. I think a punishment will help you stay awake in future. Come up to the front of the class.
You're going to punish me in front of everyone?!
Yes Rachel. Punishing you in my office didn't change your behaviour, perhaps the embarrassment of being punished in front of your peers will do the trick.
Now come to the front of the class while I decide what to do with you.
You text Miss Newman to come to your class.
Rachel, school rules state that when receiving corporal punishment you must remove your, cardigan tie and skirt.
Now, remove your clothes and bend over my desk.
My skirt?
Falling asleep while I am teaching you is very disrespectful, you will do as ordered or you will receive a much worse punishment.
Yes sir.
Hello sir. I got your message. Sorry I was down by the lake teaching volleyball and I didn't have time to go change.
No problem Miss Newman. You did the right thing coming straight here.
I'm afraid Rachel still needs some help staying awake in class. I believe a sore bottom will prevent her from falling asleep again.
Yes Mr [surname]. OK Rachel, bend over the headmaster's desk.
You messaged for me?
Yes, Rachel here needs some help staying awake in class. I believe a sore bottom will prevent her from falling asleep again.
Yes Mr [surname]. OK Rachel, bend over the headmaster's desk.
Rachel, remove you cardigan and tie and bend over my desk. Miss Newman is going to spank you.
Yes sir.
You messaged for me?
Yes, Rachel here needs some help staying awake in class. I believe a sore bottom will prevent her from falling asleep again.
Yes Mr [surname]. OK Rachel, bend over the headmaster's desk.
Miss Newman gives the girl a sound thrashing and the girls learn the importance of paying attention in class. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +2. However, the interruption prevented you from completing your lesson, {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} have not improved.
Miss Newman gives the girl a sound thrashing and the girls. They feel extra sorry for Rachel as she had to remove her skirt and are keen to avoid the same fate. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +3.

You are teaching a history lesson when you spot Cassandra using her phone.
Cassandra!
What?!
You are using your phone.
Yeah, so what?!
Firstly it's rude and disrespectful to use your phone while I am teaching and secondly you are supposed to be paying attention to the lesson.
I'm afraid you must be punished for this.
As you are already being punished in my office this evening I will have to punish you now. Come up to the front of the class and bend over my desk.
Report to my office after school. I'll decide what to do with you then.

This again?! For fucks sake.
Yes this again. Clearly you haven't learnt your lesson. Miss Newman will be here any moment to deliver your punishment.
