My father is a wealthy philanthropist. He gives a lot of money to food banks for the poor.
You know, my family probably paid for a lot of your meals when you were growing up.
Whatever Donna.
I heard that your mother...
Shut up!
What's that Debbie?
Shut your fucking face Donna!
Oofff!
You filthy urchin. How dare you touch me?!
Don't talk about my mum!
Debbie! What are you doing?
Mr [surname]. She was being really rude and I...
Violence is not the answer. See me in my office this evening young lady.
Yes sir.
You arrive in class to find Debbie performing uniform inspections.
Come on you three, whatever the hell your names are. Skirts right up! Let's check those knickers!
Thank you Debbie but everyone please sit down now as we need to start the lesson.
You heard the headmaster! Everyone sit down and be quiet.
Debbie helps to keep the class in line and everyone stays quiet. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +2.
You also teach your entire lesson with no interruptions. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +2.
As you arrive at your classroom you find Debbie has Lucy in a headlock.
Debbie! What the hell do you think you're doing?
Nothing sir I was just...
Let go of Lucy this instant.
Whatever you say Headmaster.
Debbie!
You OK down there Lucy?
I'm OK sir.
You will be punished for this Debbie.
As you are already being punished in my office this evening I will have to punish you now. Come up to the front of the class and bend over my desk.
I'll give you a warning this time Debbie. Don't let me catch you bullying again.
Whatever.
You decide to let it slide this one time. The girls don't appreciate you being soft on bullies {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} - 1 and this sets a very bad example {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} -1.
Report to my office after school. I'll decide what to do with you then.
You resolve to deal with the girl in your office after school. The girls reluctantly settled down and class continues without further interruption. You manage to get most of your lesson completed. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +1.
Debbie remove your cardigan and tie and come stand in front of my desk.
You what?
Miss Newman is going to spank you in front of the class.
In front of everyone?!
Yes, it only seems fair to let poor Lucy here witness your punishment.
Miss Newman gives the girl a sound thrashing and the girls learn the importance of paying attention in class. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +2. However, the interruption prevented you from completing your lesson, {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} have not improved.
It's a windy day outside and the girls are struggling with their skirts.
The girls appreciate you respecting their modesty. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} + 1.
You decide to take a closer look to make sure the girls are obeying the underwear regulations.
Oh it seems Liz still hasn't found replacements for her blue underwear.
The girls notice you looking up their skirts.
They all run off. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} -1.
