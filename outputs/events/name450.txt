I'll take it. If that's all that is available.
Prove yourself young lady and perhaps we can find something more challenging for you in time.
Thank you sir. I will come to your house on Saturday morning.
Excellent. See you then.
Perfect. I was getting sick of doing my own washing up.
I think maybe I should buy some suitable clothes for Lucy to wear while she's cleaning.
You walk the school grounds and see the twins practising football.
You give the girls a wave and carry on with your patrol. Nothing else interesting happens.
You offer to play with the girls and give them some pointers. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +1
Whilst patrolling the school you come across Amy and Alice wearing entirely inappropriate clothing.
Good morning girls
Good afternoon girls.
Alice and Amy what are you wearing?!
It's the weekend, we can wear whatever we like!
You'll give the school a bad name. Now go and change immediately!
What? That's so unfair.
The girls head off to change. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +1 {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} -1.
Hi girls. Looking good.
You like our outfits sir?
They look a little skimpy but I guess you can wear whatever you like on the weekend.
Thanks sir. See you around.
The girls appreciate you not telling them what to do. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +1 {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} -1.
Whilst patrol the grounds you encounter Liz and Faye sunbathing on the roof.
Hi girls how are you doing?
We're good sir, thanks for asking.
Where did you find the deck chairs?
Oh, they were up here already. We think maybe Miss Newman comes up here sometimes.
I hope you are wearing adequate protection from the sun.
Well, no sir. We don't have any suncream.
You're in luck. I always carry some in this hot weather.
Sun bathing again girls? I hope you've got sun cream on?
No actually, sir.
Well, its a good thing I always carry some on me.
Thanks sir, we'll just put this on each other.
Faye, can you do my back?
Sure thing but you have to do me next.
My turn! Do me, do me.
I'm trying! Hold still!
Thanks very much sir, you are so considerate!
No problem girls. We wouldn't want you getting burnt. See you around.
The girls are grateful for your help. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +1.
Err no thanks sir we can just put this on each other.
Good, we would want you getting burnt.
Err, yeah see you around.
You creeped the girls out a little your {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} decreases slightly.
If you wouldn't mind doing our backs, sir?
Not at all, we wouldn't want you getting burnt.
Um... Mr [surname]?
Yes, Liz?
I'm a bit embarrassed to ask, but... I'm trying to avoid getting tanlines.
