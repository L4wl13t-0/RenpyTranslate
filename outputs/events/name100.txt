You think things are bad for you now? They will get a lot worse if you fail or are expelled again.
This is your last warning Cassandra. Bend over the desk.
Fuck.
Very good.
Hey don't laugh at me!
Is that a thong you are wearing Cassandra?
Yeah so what?!
Why must you girls insist on disregarding the uniform policy?
What does it matter?!
It shows you have respect for the rules. Even in ways that cannot normally be seen.
I think we have to come up with some stricter rules regarding the uniform policy.
For now though we have more important matters to attend to.
Miss Newman. If you would please teach this young lady some manners.
Perhaps then the lesson can continue uninterrupted.
Yes, Mr [surname].
OK Cassandra, you must know by know all girls who are to receive corporal punishment must remove their skirts.
My skirt? You mean in front of class and everything?!
Oh yes. Your classmates need to know what happens to naughty girls who misbehave.
Now take your clothes off before I have Miss Newman remove them for you.
This is so unfair.
Very good young lady. Now bend over the desk for your spanking.
You make an example of Cassandra and the girls learn the price of bad behaviour. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +2.

You arrive at your classroom early only to find Amy there already.
Amy. I'm glad to see you've finally learned to get to your lesson on time.
Yes sir! I made a real effort to leave the gym as quickly as possible.
So quickly that you forgot your tie?
Oops... I can run back and get it.
No, then you'll miss the start of the lesson.
I'll let you off just this once but don't forget your tie again.
No sir. Thank you sir.
You go on to teach your entire lesson with no interruptions. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +2.
I'm sorry Amy but you know we have a strict uniform policy at this school. See me in my office this afternoon for punishment.
Yes, Mr [surname].

You had just started teaching your class when you are interrupted by a latecomer.
Amy, what time do you think this is?
I'm sorry sir, I was...
I don't want excuses girl. Tardiness is not acceptable and where is your tie?
Oh I must have left it in the changing rooms.
I will need to speak to you about this behaviour Miss Street. Report to my office after lessons.
Yes, sir. Sorry sir.
You resolve to deal with the trouble maker in your class after school. The girls settle down and you're able to complete your lesson. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +1.
Late again Amy?!
Sorry sir I came as fast as I could.
Clearly that is not the case and once again you are not wearing your tie. You must be punished for this behaviour.
As you are already seeing me in my office this evening I will have to punish you now.
I'll give you a warning this time Amy. Don't be late again.
Thank you sir!
You decide to let it slide this one time. The girls appreciate you being lenient {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} + 1. However, this sets a very bad example {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} -1.
