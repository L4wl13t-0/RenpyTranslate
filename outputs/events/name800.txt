OK sir. If you insist. I have my uniform in my backpack.
I'll just go change in the bathroom.
A few minutes later.
OK sir. I'm changed and ready. What would you like me to do first.
You can start by doing the washing up and then the laundry, then clean the floors.
Yes sir.
I'll be in the living room. Let me know if you need anything.
Lucy cleans your flat while you take a well deserved rest.
All finished sir. Can I get paid now please?
Of course. Here's 30 as promised.
Thank you sir. I'll see you next week.
A maid outfit? That's a little strange sir.
Not at all. If you are to be my maid you should be dressed as one.
I don't know...
If you want me to dress up for you I think you should pay me an extra 20.
OK. I'll just go change in the bathroom then.
Several minutes later
Lucy sure is taking her time. Maybe I should check up on her?
Maybe I'll just take a quick peek, make sure she's OK.
She's fine, just taking her time. I should probably leave, she could turn around at any second.
Eeeek!!! Sir, what are you doing!
I was just err..
Close the door!
Ah crap.
I think I'd better leave sir.
Lucy wait.
Oh great. Now I have to do all the cleaning myself.
I hope she comes back next week.
I'd better wait for her downstairs.
OK sir. I'm changed and ready. What would you like me to do first.
You can start by doing the washing up and then the laundry, then clean the floors.
Yes sir.
I'll be in the living room. Let me know if you need anything.
Lucy cleans your flat while you take a well deserved rest.
All finished sir. Can I get paid now please?
Sure. Here's 30 as promised plus an extra 20 for dressing appropriately.
Thank you sir. I'll see you next week.
I'm not paying you extra.
Well then I won't be putting on that outfit.
Good morning Mr [surname], I'm here to clean your flat again.
Excellent. Come inside.
So did you want me to wear the maid outfit again? I could really do with the extra money.
Yes, of course. You can go change upstairs. I shall be reading my paper in the living room.
OK sir. No problem.
Ah, it's good to have someone to take care of the chores for me.
What should I do to relax now though?
I think maybe I shall take a bath.
Lucy.
Yes Mr [surname].
I wish to take a bath. Please fill up the tub with hot water and bring some fresh towels to the bathroom.
