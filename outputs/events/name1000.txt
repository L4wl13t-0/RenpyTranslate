Yes, Mr [surname].
Make me some breakfast will you. Bacon and eggs please.
Yes sir.
Oh, and brew up some fresh coffee. There are coffee beans and a grinder in the cupboard.
Um, OK.
You wait patiently while Lucy cooks you up some breakfast.
Here you are Mr [surname].
Thank you Lucy.
Is the coffee OK?
Is everything OK? I've not brewed up fresh coffee before.
Let me have a taste.
Yuck, this coffee is completely burnt.
Are you telling the truth though, sir? Last time you said you liked it but you hardly drank any.
Really, it's fine.
Well, let me try some then.
Yay, I'm glad I got it right.
Thank you Lucy. You are a treasure.
No problem sir. I'll get back to the cleaning then.
You enjoy your breakfast while Lucy finishes cleaning the flat.
Really?
Yes Lucy, you've over brewed it.
Are you sure sir? I followed the instructions on the coffee packet...
Here, you try it and tell me what you think.
Um, I don't really drink coffee. I'm not sure what its supposed to taste like.
It's overly bitter. See for yourself.
OK sir.
Bluggghhh!
Yuck!
Lucy.
Oh god, I'm so sorry sir. That's terrible.
Lucy.
Soo gross. Oh my god.
Lucy!
Yeah?
You have spat coffee all over your dress.
Oh no!
Get it in the wash immediately before it stains.
Right, I'll go change upstairs.
No young lady, I said immediately. If that uniform is stained I will be deducting the substantial cost from your pay.
What?! But that's not fair!
You had better move fast Lucy, I can see the coffee drying as we speak.
Eeeek!
Get to the laundry room girl. Post-haste.
Um, so I need to take my dress off now. Do you mind not watching me?
OK, I'll look the other way but you better move quickly. It's an expensive dress. You need to make sure it gets in the wash right away.
OK sir. Just give me a moment.
Lucy is wearing stripped underwear under her uniform! I expected better from her.
There it's in the wash.
You are wearing blue stripy underwear Lucy.
Yeah, but it's not school hours. Surely I can wear whatever I like?
