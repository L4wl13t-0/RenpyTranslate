Report to my office after lessons I will decide what to do with you then.
Yes, sir. Sorry sir.
You resolve to deal with the trouble maker in your class after school. The girls settle down and you are able to complete your lesson. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +1.
I believe a public punishment is in order. Amy remove your cardigan and come stand in front of my desk.
Yes sir.
Knock knock
You called for me sir?
Yes Miss Newman. I'm afraid that once again Amy has decided to be late and disrupt my lesson. Please give the girl a spanking.
Yes Mr [surname].
Go ahead and bend over the desk Amy.
Err... Sir, can we do this in your office?
What's the matter Amy I thought you liked being spanked?
Sir! Don't say that.
Have you gone shy suddenly, now that your class mates are watching? You were moaning in pleasure when we spanked you in my office.
No I wasn't!
Yes you were Amy. Now hurry up and bend over the desk, I have my own class to get back to.
Please begin Miss Newman.
Ooooooh...
Ha! Sounds like Amy does like getting spanked.
Ooooooh...
Sir.
Yes April?
Why would anyone enjoy being spanked?
Well I believe Amy is what is technically referred to as a masochist.
What's a masochist?
A masochist is a person who derives sexual gratification from being subjected to physical pain or humiliation.
You mean she's getting off from being spanked in front of everyone?
He means she's a total pervert April.
Not at all, Cassandra. It's a fairly common trait and nothing to be ashamed of. Perhaps in another lesson we can explore this topic further.
I'm sure Amy would be happy to discuss her fetish in front of everybody.
No I wouldn't. Please don't talk about me like this!
Ooooooh...
Please begin Miss Newman.
Miss Newman gives the girl a sound thrashing and the girls learn the importance of being on time to lessons. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +2. However, the interruption prevented you for completing your lesson. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} have not improved.
As the girls listen to Amy's moans of pleasure they start to feel slightly aroused themselves. {color=#df7ac4}Horniness + 1{/color}.

Well done you have earned your first point of Horniness. Horniness is not like the other statistics. There will be a limited number available and they will be more difficult to find.
You teach the class history but the girls aren't really paying attention.
Rachel.
Hmmmm...
Rachel wake up!
Oh my goodness.
Am I boring you?
Err... No sir.
Report to my office after school. We can talk about this then.
Eeek...
You resolve to deal with Rachel in your office after school and manage to continue your lesson uninterrupted. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +1.
You catch Rachel falling asleep again. What do you do?
Rachel!
Oh my gosh!
