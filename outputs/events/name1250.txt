Thank you sir. Let me know if you need help with anything else.
I will. See you later Priti.
OK, now to check whether she logged in to her account.
Ah ha! Bingo. She did log in and the keylogger recorded her password.
Let's have a look and see what photos she's got backed up in the cloud.
Hmmm... nothing too exciting. Mostly just selfies and few photos of other girls from the school.
That looks like my maid Lucy with Rachel.
That's Rachel plus that girl Lucy, who keeps asking to speak to me about something.
Oh, I believe that's Maxine and Donna. Priti seems to have lots of friends.
Oh here we go. This is the kind of thing Charles was looking for. A great bikini shot with Amy and Harriet.
Is that the lake on campus? I should really get that opened up again as soon as possible.
I must say the girls at this school are all very attractive. It seems like one hell of a coincidence.
Mr Mykock said the girls at this school were all hand picked. Were they selected for their looks as well as their behaviour I wonder?
No, that's ridiculous. What possible reason could they have for doing that?
Ah ha! What do we have here. The classic mirror selfie.
Shame she has her hand in the way.
Oh and one from behind. Superb. I wonder who she took this photo for. Or maybe it was just for herself.
There doesn't seem to be any nudes though.
Hardly surprising. Priti doesn't seem like that kind of girl.
Oh well. I hope this is enough to keep Charles happy.
I'll meet with him at his apartment in the evening to let him know.
Scene where we discus with Mykock how to get extra money. He tells you about putting a camera into your office
You now get money when punishing girls in your office.
Scene where we meet Jimmy.
Good day girls, how are you?
Girls" "We've very well thank you headmaster.
Girls" "
See you in class sir.
OK girls. I need to check your uniforms.
Raise your skirts so I can see your underwear.
But sir...
This is the school policy. Submit to an inspection or be punished.
Yes sir...
Very good. I see you are all wearing regulation underwear.
You may carry on.
Yes sir...
