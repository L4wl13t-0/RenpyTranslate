Oooh sir...
Thank God she's gone.
Thank God who's gone sir?
Quiet Sarah, I need to finish quickly before my alarm goes off again.
What?
Never you mind. I'm just going to have to fuck you very hard now.
Oooh sir...
Oh sir... you're going to make me...
Oh sir... you're going to make me...
Oh sir...
Here it comes.
My goodness.
Ah, just in time. What do we say Sarah?
Thank you for punishing me sir.
Good girl.
Wow, what a vivid dream. Really felt like I was back in my old office with Sarah.
Hmmm... That's not happened for a long time.
I'd better hit the shower before heading in to work.
What is with these strange dreams though?
Maybe I should stop eating so much cheese in the evenings.
Anyway. No time to dwell on that now. I have a school to run and girls to punish.
Debbie stop talking, you are interrupting the lesson.
Whatever. Who cares about some stupid poet who died hundreds of years ago?
You should, if you want to pass your exams.
Now sit down and stop interrupting my lesson!
Or what?
Last warning Debbie! You know I have the authority to spank you.
You wouldn't.
Try me!
Whoa, there. Alright Miss. Calm down. Jesus.
For once let's just be quiet and continue with the lesson. We have a lot material left to go through.
Oh headmaster, I didn't see you there.
Miss Potts could I have a quick word with you in the hallway?
Of course Mr [surname].
I did it! I got the class to settle down!
You really are an expert in {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color}.
Thank you so much for your help [cname].
Mmmmmm....
Oh my gosh I'm so sorry. That was inappropriate of me.
That's OK. Your emotions got the better of you.
You have done well but your training is far from over. I'll come visit you again in your apartment and we can run through the next step.
Oh I can't wait. I feel so much more confident now already.
What good luck that you came to this school and are willing to help me.
See you soon [cname].
Class I have a special treat for you today.
In keeping with our lessons on Napoleon I have with me today a genuine Napoleonic era pistol.
It's not loaded and completely harmless of course.
I always find history is much more interesting when we can see real artifacts first hand.
I'll need a volunteer to show it round to the class.
Now who to pick...
