You calling me a liar?
Yeah, I'm calling you a liar, always whining when you lose.
You're such a bitch Charlotte!
Who you calling a bitch?! You're going down.
Bring it!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
This looks like it could get out of hand. Should I intervene or let them sort out their differences?
That's enough. Both of you need to take a step back and calm down.
There's no need to be so competitive.
The girls calm down and you are able to continue with the practise. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +1.
Grrrr...
You decide to let girls fight it out
The fight is pretty even and neither girl retains the advantage for long.
Eventually they both get too tired and collapse.
I'm sorry I called you a liar April. Maybe I did push you a little bit.
I'm sorry I called you bitch Charlotte.
The girls appreciated you letting resolve their own disputes but this sort of behaviour is very bad for {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color}. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +1 {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} -2
You finish changing and join the girls for football practice. They don't seem very interested in your lesson and are all sat around talking.
You decide to let the girls have some well earned rest. They really enjoy the chance to sit and chat.
They are grateful for you giving them some time off. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +1
Come on girls. This is a sports lesson not a mothers' meeting. Now drop and give me fifty!
You force the girls to exercise.
Tired girls are less likely to cause trouble. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +1.
You finish changing and join the girls for their sports lesson.
Today you teach the importance of stretching.
Come on girls touch those toes!
You finish changing and join the girls for football practice.
Today you make the girls do exercise drills.

Hi girls. Today I think we should play a match. Please split into two teams again.
Sir.
Yes Charlotte.
We all have the same uniform on.
Your point being?
How are we going to tell the teams apart?
Each team should have different uniforms.
There are only five of you on each team Charlotte I'm sure you can manage.
Not with the twins sir.
But we don't look that much alike.
They're fucking identical.
Language Charlotte.
Sorry sir.
I see your point Charlotte but we don't have different uniforms for you to wear.
Why don't you put the twins on the same team?
No way! The twins are the best players. We can't put them on the same team.
Can't you think of something else sir?
No. Sorry Charlotte. We're not arranging a different sports uniform just for this class. You'll just have to remember who's on which team.
You spend the rest of the session playing a practice game.
Charlotte has a good point. The twins do seem to be the best players meaning putting them on the same team would make the game too one sided.
The game eventually ends in a draw.
