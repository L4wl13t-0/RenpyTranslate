It's good to see Trixie is at least taking being a dance teacher more seriously than being a lab technician.
Hello everyone.
Girls" "Hello headmaster
Girls" "
Well don't you all look adorable in your dance clothes?
Debbie. I didn't expect to see you here. You don't strike me as the type to enjoy dance lessons.
Yeah. Well, shows what you know.
Uh huh. You know what, I think I have a pretty good idea why you're here.
How's it going Miss Star?
Hiya Mr [surname], come to watch the girls dance?
Yes, why not.
Great! Just take a seat over by the side sugar and enjoy the show.
You take a seat at the side of the gymnasium and watch the lesson. To your surprise Trixie is actually a very good dance teacher.
By the end of the lesson she has taught the girls a pretty decent dance routine.
So what did you think of the dancing Mr [surname]?
Very good job Trixie. I look forward to seeing more dances in the future.
This is the end of the dance lesson story line for now but it will be continued in a future update.
No, I don't have time I'm afraid. I'll see you all later.
Hello there.
Hello headmaster.
I like your outfit Lucy.
Thank you sir. We're doing a play about Greek mythology.
We're working on our costumes in the gymnasium at the moment.
Marvellous. And which character are you?
I'm Hermes. The winged messenger!
Fantastic! Sounds like this is going to be a good play. I should check out the gymnasium.
OK sir. See you later.
Hi Donna, hi Priti.
How are you girls getting on?
Good thanks.
Which Greek gods are you two?
I'm Zeus! God of thunder and king of all gods and men.
