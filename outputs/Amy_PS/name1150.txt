Yes, sir.
Amy, don't forget I want some feedback from you during your punishments.
Let us know how painful this is in comparison to being spanked.
Yes, sir.
Ow!
Ow wow that really stings!
Ah!
How does it compare to the spanking Amy?
It's definitely more painful, sir. The anticipation before the blows is much more intense.
Miss Newman, pay attention to how I alternate between building anticipation and hitting the girl.
Yes, sir.
Oh Mr [surname]...
Aaaah!
Gosh, that one really hurt. Thank you Mr [surname].
Hmmmmm... She still seems to be enjoying herself, sir.
True but at least we've found a way to actually cause the girl some pain.
Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.
OK Miss Newman, let's use that crop again on Amy's inner thigh.
Yes, sir.
You do not have enough Action Points.
You'll need to take your skirt and knickers off for this next punishment.
Amy there is only one punishment appropriate for such a serious offence.
One that I think even you will not enjoy.
Miss Newman, please fetch the cane from the shelf over there.
Yes, sir.
The cane?!
Yes Amy. I personally hate to use such an extreme punishment but you've left me with little choice.
Yes, sir. I understand. I really am sorry and I think that I deserve this.
The cane is a lot more painful than anything you are used to Amy.
Would you like me to carry out the punishment, sir?
No Miss Newman. As the headmaster I believe it is my responsibility. I would never delegate such a serious task.
Are you ready Amy?
Um... Yes, sir.
OK good.
