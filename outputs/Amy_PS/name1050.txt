Take your thumb and forefinger and gently pinch the nipple.
Start lightly at first and then steadily increase the pressure.
Oh yes, that's starting to hurt a little.
Be sure to carefully observe the student's reactions.
Once the student has started to display discomfort then you'll want to give the nipple a little twist.
Ouch.
Perhaps even a slight tug.
Oooh.
Then you'll want to alternate between pinching, twisting and tugging.
Mmmmm...
Um, aren't I the one supposed to be being punished?
Quiet Amy.
How does this feel?
Well, it's painful sure but it's not entirely unpleasant. It feels kinda good too.
Indeed. Interesting isn't it that just the right amount of pressure can cause both pleasure and pain simultaneously.
Mmmmm...
OK, I think you've got the idea. Let's try it on Amy.
Sure, so who goes first?
I'll supervise you for the first time.
Sure. Hold still now, Amy.
Eeeek. No stop.
Hands back up over your head, Amy.
Please be gentle. My nipples are very sensitive.
Hands behind your head.
But Miss...
If you cannot stay still Amy I shall have to hold back your arms myself.
There. Proceed Miss Newman.
Wait Miss, please don't, they are too sensitive.
Shhhh... Its OK Amy, this will only hurt a bit.
You might find that you enjoy it a little bit too.
Eeeek!
I'm just going to give them a bit of a pinch OK?
Ouch!
Ooooh...
Oh Miss... That feels funny.
I thinks she's starting to enjoy it a little, sir.
Yes, well done Miss Newman, you are a natural at this. Please continue.
I'll go first and show you how it's done.
Hold still now Amy.
Wait no stop. My nipples are too sensitive.
Hands back behind your head.
But, Sir...
Miss Newman, could you please restrain the girl.
Yes, sir.
Eeeek!
Shhh... It's OK Amy, the headmaster is just going to pinch your nipples.
It will hurt a little but you might find that you enjoy it a little bit too.
OK Amy, this is going to pinch a little.
Ouch!
Ooooh...
