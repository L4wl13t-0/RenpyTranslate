It's too much!

You do not have enough Action Points.
Miss Newman, as you know one of our main goals when punishing the girls is to cause the maximum response from the least amount of actual physical harm.
Amy's exposed nipples provide us with an excellent opportunity to put this principle into practice.
Let's move in front of her shall we.
Nipples are extremely sensitive and a light pinch can cause as much pain as a hard smack to the bottom.
That makes sense. The less we have to actually hit the girls the better right?
Indeed. Let's test this out on Amy.
Sure. She's very small though I'd want to be careful not to really hurt her.
Yes, applying the right amount of pressure can be a little tricky.
Perhaps if you would allow me to demonstrate on you first?
Sure. Good idea.
