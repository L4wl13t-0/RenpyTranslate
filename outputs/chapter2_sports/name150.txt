Well done, Alice!
However the other team also plays well and the final score is a draw.
Ha! Even with Alice able to run, your team still couldn't beat us.
Yeah, I guess you're not as good as you thought.
We didn't lose either. The game was a draw.
OK girls. That's all we have time for today girls.
But sir, who's going to be skins next game?
We'll have to decide that before the next practice match.
You head out for another practice game but the girls seem to be arguing.
Time for another game girls. Who is going to be skins this time around?
It's their turn this time.
They never beat us. The last game was a draw.
I don't see why we should switch. We think things should be the same as last week.
Don't be a bitch. We've been skins for ages. You should take your tops off this time.
Fuck you! Who are you calling a bitch?!
I'm calling you a bitch. Bitch!
OK girls, take a deep breath. Calm down. It's just football practice.
No one won the last game so normally when that happens the game goes to a penalty shootout.
Each player gets a turn to take a shot against the goalkeeper.
Whichever team gets the most goals wins and gets to keep their shirt on for today's game.
Bring it on! Those losers can't shoot for shit!
Oh yeah, we'll see about that! I'm the best goalkeeper in the school. No way youï¿½re going to win.
Ha! Good one! How about we make it interesting then?
A bet?
Yeah, if you lose you all have to take your shirts and your shorts off, not just Alice.
We'd all have to play in just our bras?
Yeah.
Alright, fine but the same goes for you if we win.
Alright, youï¿½re on!
Are you sure about this April?
Don't worry, Harriet. We won't lose!
Oh you will and you'd better not chicken out of the bet when you do.
You'll enforce the bet, right headmaster?
Sure. A bet's a bet.
So who's going to take the first penalty?
I will!
Watch and learn everyone!
April scores. One point to her team.
Ha! In your face Charlotte! Best goalkeeper in the school, my arse.
That was a lucky shot.
OK it's the next teamï¿½s turn to shoot. Who's up next?
I'll shoot next.
I'll be the goalkeeper.
Fuck!
I saved it!
God damn it.
Haha!
Each team still has four penalties left. It's not over yet.
The girls take turns shooting at the goal. Both twins score easily.
Rachel, Alice, Cassandra and Harriet all score their goals as well.
