We think April's team should be skins today
Plus they have to take off their shirts and shorts just like we did last time.
Yeah, yeah. A bets a bet. Whatever.
Come on, girls.
Hehe.
What the hell?!
Ha! You think we're idiots? We knew we'd have to play without our shorts today so wore our knickers underneath.
That's not fair! We had to play bottomless.
Me and Rachel were basically naked!
The bet was if we lost we'd have to take our shirts and shorts off.
No one said we couldn't put knickers on underneath.
You bitch!
It's not my fault your team didn't come prepared.
Mr [surname], this isn't fair.
I am inclined to agree with you, Charlotte.
This clearly goes against the spirit of the bet you made last week, if not the exact wording.
Make them take their knickers off! You said you would enforce the bet.
Hmmm... I did say that, although I don't really think I should use my authority as a teacher to enforce silly bets between students.
Ha!
But sir...
However, there is a more serious health issue at play here as well as a potential breach of the school rules.
The school issue sports shorts have a breathable lining and are clearly intended to be worn without knickers.
This is to ensure adequate ventilation for your feminine parts and to reduce the risk of a UTI.
Standard school knickers are not intended for sports use.
Therefore, I would argue that during sports lessons they fall within the category of inappropriate clothing and should be confiscated.
Yes!
Are you serious?!
When it comes to matters affecting your health I am always totally serious, April.
So how often have you been putting knickers on under your sports shorts?
Errr...
Did your team wear them just today or have you been wearing them for a while?
Well, we weren't sure when the next practice game was so...
So you've been wearing them under your shorts for a while?
Just these last few lessons.
Oh dear me, April. This will not do. This will not do at all.
Take your knickers off now, all five of you, before you find yourselves in trouble.
You know my feelings about hiding things beneath your clothes.
Perhaps I should be looking under your shorts every sports lesson.
Or perhaps we will have to take away your shorts permanently if you can't be trusted with them.
No, no. Don't do that. We'll take our knickers off.
Damn it, I knew this wouldn't work.
It was worth a try, April, but I guess we'll have to play bottomless after all.
At least we all have our bras on and won't have to play naked like Rachel and Charlotte did.
Yeah, I guess. It's still really embarrassing though.
That's better.
Haha. Not so smug now are you, April?
Come on girls, if Charlotte's team can win wearing just bras then so can we.
We'll just have to pretend we're not basically naked.
OK girls. Let's not waste any more time. Let's get the game started.
We want Aprilï¿½s team to take off their shirts and shorts.
