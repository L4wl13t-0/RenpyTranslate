There. Now I'm naked too Rachel and you're not the only one.
Plus look, my boobs aren't any bigger than yours. Weï¿½re both an A-cup.
Charlotte....
I should take my bra off too.
No, the rest of you have big boobs you'll need all the support you can get if we're gonna best April.
Yeah, I suppose so.
Me and Rachel can be naked together.
*sniff*
Thank you, Charlotte. I do feel better not being the only one.
It's OK, we're all in this together.
This time we're gonna win.
So whichever teams loses will have to play bottomless in the next practice game.
As the referee, I should be able to exert some influence over the final score.
The game starts. With so much to play for, both teams try their hardest and it's a fiercely competitive game.
Alice scores an early goal but it looked like she was in an offside position.
Go Alice! You rule!
Woo hoo! An early lead for us!
She was offside, sir! That goal doesn't count.
Yeah, no way that was a goal.
Alice was on-side. The goal stands.
What the fuck! No way.
The refereeï¿½s decision is final April.
Charlotte's team is winning one-nil.
Yes! We can win this girls, even without our shorts!
Alice was clearly offside. The goal is disallowed!
No fucking way!
The refereeï¿½s decision is final Alice. April's team gets a free-kick.
April's team takes a quick free-kick and her team scores on the counter-attack.
Damn it! No!
It's one-nil to April's team.
The game continues and Mary picks up the ball and makes a break down the centre.
She made it within the penalty area and it looked as if she was about to score.
However, Louise comes in hard with a thumping tackle against her twin.
Ooof!
Are you OK, Mary?
Ouch! That hurt but I'm OK.
That was a penalty, sir!
No way was that a penalty! That was a fair tackle, I got the ball.
It was a foul, Mr [surname]! You have to give a penalty!
Mary's team gets to take a penalty.
Yes! Go on Mary!
Mary prepares to take the penalty kick.
She scores easily and the girls celebrate.
Woo! Go Mary!
That was a fair tackle. It's a goal kick.
What! No fair!
Charlotte kicks the ball to the other end of the field where Louise was already in position.
Did you see that!
Oh my goodness, Louise! You're so awesome!
Fuck! Come on girls we can still do this.
