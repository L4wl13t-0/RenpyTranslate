With Charlotte's team still one goal behind. The last girl on April's team steps up for her turn.
Oh my. I'm so nervous.
You can do it, Emily. If you score this one we've won.
Here goes.
Did I score?!
That was pathetic.
Oh dear.
Emily!
There's still one girl to shoot for Charlotte's team. If Liz scores then it's a draw and we'll have to go to sudden death.
Liz you're up. It's all down to you now. If you miss this then we have to play in just our bras for the next match.
I don't want to give April the satisfaction of seeing us humiliated.
Don't worry Charlotte, I got this.
You can do it, Liz!
We believe in you!
Oops...
Liz missed. April's team are the winners.
Oh crap.
Yes! Haha! You have to play in just your bras!
But I don't even have a bra.
I'm sorry guys.
Liz?! How could you?
You missed too, Charlotte!
Grrr...
Liz is right, Charlotte, you missed a shot and you were goalkeeper. You are more to blame than Liz.
Plus it was your hubris that led to this bet being made in the first place.
It's time to honour your agreement.
Liz, go stand with your teammates.
Do we really have to do this, sir?
You were the one who told me to enforce the deal. I'm afraid you lost fair and square. Shirts and shorts off girls.
I guess we have to. Damn it.
At least I won't be the only one this time I guess.
Well done for honouring your bet, girls. It shows good character.
It shows a lot more than that. Haha.
They are all basically naked. Especially Rachel. What a skinny little runt.
Don't be mean, Cassandra. You know I won't stand for body shaming.
We might be naked but I bet we still win.
Ha, not likely.
If we do then your team has to be bottomless next time, April.
Yeah whatever, there's no way we're gonna lose.
Your team is going to end up playing bottomless for the rest of the school year.
Come on girls. We just have to pretend we're not naked. We can't waste our time trying to cover ourselves or we'll lose.
But Charlotte, I feel very self-conscious. I was embarrassed enough when everyone saw my tiny boobs.
Now I'm totally naked. The headmaster can see how small and skinny I am compared to everyone else.
I'm sorry, Rachel. I know you're shy but you're just going to have to suck it up.
If we lose today we'll have to be bottomless again next time we play.
*crying*
Oh no... Don't cry, Rachel.
Damn it, why did I make that bet?
What are we going to do, Charlotte? We need Rachel in defence. We'll never win if she's this upset and keeps trying to cover herself.
I think I know what to do. I'm just going to have to take one for the team.
