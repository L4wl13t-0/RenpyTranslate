They would like to see for themselves that the girls are being properly disciplined.
What do you mean?
There is a small camera hidden in your office in the corner by the window.
A hidden camera?!
Yes.
I'm not sure how I feel about being watched in my office.
Have no fear! We are not interested in anything you choose to get up to in this office with the staff or even the students.
The camera can be switched on and off through your computer.
We are only interested in how the girls are being punished.
If the owners approve then additional funds will be released for you to spend as you wish.
How will I know what the owners want to see?
If your demonstration at the teacher conference is anything to go by then I am sure they will be most pleased!
Most pleased indeed!
So are you willing to accept these terms?
{i}I don't particularly mind if my employers watch me work.{/i}
{i}Ultimately I want my methods recorded so that they can be introduced more widely.{/i}
{i}Plus the school's facilities do need upgrading, if this is the only way to get extra funding I guess I don't have a choice.{/i}
{i}I wonder if this is the offer that made the old headmaster so angry?{/i}
{i}He turned Mr Mykock down and ended up dead soon after.{/i}
{i}Another good reason to agree to his request. Until I find out how the old headmaster died I should be careful.{/i}
I can agree to those terms Paul.
Excellent! Check your email later confirming payment.
I so glad you are more accommodating than the last headmaster.
See you soon [name]!
{i}Sweet Jesus. That man gives me the creeps.{/i}
Knock knock
Come in.
Hello again sir. I hope that the sports lesson went well.
At this time of day any girls requiring punishment will be sent to your office.
I understand that Debbie Harris was misbehaving in Miss Potts' class earlier today.
She is waiting outside at the moment would you like me to send her in?
Yes please Samantha.
Hold on a minute.
Hello Ruth, I'm afraid I am busy at the moment. Please come back another time.
I don't think so and that is Miss Thomas to you.
Right, well what do you want?
I understand that a girl has been sent here for punishment?
Yes.
Why was I not informed?
Why would you be informed?
Because I am here to monitor the school and protect the well-being of the girls.
I must be present during any punishment to ensure it is performed within strict guidelines.
Thank you Miss Thomas, but I don't think that will be necessary.
You do not have a choice in the matter.
As the government representative at this experimental school I must document all such proceedings.
Miss Thomas, I must protest. Influencing the behaviour of the girls is a complicated task.
I can not achieve the desired effect if I have someone here undermining my authority.
You have my word the girls will not be mistreated.
Your word?
Ha! Your word means nothing to me.
