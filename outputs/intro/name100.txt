She was expected to fail again for a second time and would face the prospect of compulsory military service.
However, after a few months of behavioural therapy with myself we were able to turn things around.
Sarah is now expecting to graduate from school and is applying to university.
Sarah, why don't you tell the audience what you want to be when you are older.
I want to be an academic like you Mr [surname].
Applause.
Excellent! A noble ambition.
Pssst... Can I sit back down now please sir? Crowds make me really nervous.
No Sarah. Stay where you are.
Yes sir.
Today I would like to present to you my new method for punishing young adult students.
To some these methods may seem a little extreme.
However, as the Education Secretary has already discussed these are desperate times.
We must move past our own personal hang-ups and accept the need for radical measures.
I therefore ask you to keep an open mind and consider the effectiveness of my method ahead of all other concerns.
However, rather than bore you with the lengthy explanation I think it best if I provide a more practical demonstration.
Huh?
We shall use Sarah here as a volunteer.
You will?!
When Sarah first came to me her behaviour was unacceptable.
{size=24}I wasn't that badï¿½{/size}
Her grades were poor, she was frequently late for class and she was rude to her teachers.
{size=24}That was, like, one timeï¿½{/size}
It is a slippery slope from such misdemeanours to a life of unemployment, drug abuse and violent crime.
{size=24}Really?!{/size}
Over months of training I have modified her behaviour.
She is now well trained and fully obedient. Allow me to demonstrate.
Sarah, turn around and bend over for the first part of the demonstration.
Wait, we never talked about thisï¿½
Sarah.
You said I just had to come up and say a few words.
Sarah.
Not in front of all these peopleï¿½
You are still my test subject. Remember your training and obey my instructions.
Turn around and bend over.
Yes sir.
All the way over. Don't be shy.
Why are you doing this to me?
You are doing a good thing for your country Sarah.
Teachers and students everywhere will benefit from my presentation today.
{size=24}So unfairï¿½{/size}
As you can see Sarah is now well trained and obedient, willingly submitting to her punishment in front of an entire crowd.
How was this miraculous transformation achieved?
By using my new punishment technique which I have named the [surname] method.
This new approach to discipline relies on three key components.
The first component has been the cornerstone of discipline for millennia.
That component is pain.
But sir...
Please don't punish me in front of all these people.
Haven't I been good? I do everything that you tell me.
