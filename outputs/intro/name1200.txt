Good evening headmaster I'm Maria Consuelo. I'm in charge of overnight security.
Nice to meet you Maria.
How are the girls behaving themselves this evening?
The girls seem pretty quiet at the moment.
I'm glad to hear it. I'll let you get back to work.
Stop there please. Men are not allowed to enter the bedroom area.
But I am the headmaster. I need to make sure the girls are behaving at all times.
The rules are very clear. No men may enter. Even you sir.
Well, if you insist.
{i}Hmmm... I will need to do something about that rule.{/i}
{i}How can I be expected to understand the girls' behavioural problems if I cannot see what they are up to in their free time.{/i}
{i}For now though, maybe I can sneak around back to see what the girls are up to.{/i}
{i}Oh it's the twins.{/i}
Good evening you two.
Good evening headmaster.
What show are you watching?
We're not watching a TV show. We're just watching cat videos on the internet.
Huh, kids these days. Well don't let me keep you.
Good night Mr [surname].
{i}The girls' bedrooms are are just along here. Which window should I try first?{/i}
When spying on the girls you can only move around for so long before you are noticed. Keep an eye on the detection meter in the top right. Every time you move, wait or take an action the meter will increase.
If the meter fills then security will be alerted and you will have to flee.
{i}Some girls are having a conversation. Let's see if I can hear what they are saying.{/i}
Oh my God its so hot at the moment. I'm so glad to be out of my uniform.
So did you hear what happened in Miss Potts' English class?
Yes, everyone is talking about it. Debbie Harris threw a water balloon at Miss Potts. Her shirt went see-through and everyone saw her boobs!
The headmaster walked in and everything. She must have been so embarrassed.
Debbie can be such a bitch sometimes.
What happened then?
The headmaster ordered her to his office after school.
What do you think he did to her?
The rumour is she got spanked.
No way! What, by the headmaster?
No, by Miss Newman but the headmaster watched.
Good. Serves her right. Wish I could have seen that!
Aren't you guys worried though? What if you get sent to the headmaster's office?
Good point! We'd better be careful not to get in trouble.
{i}Good to see that the girls are worried about getting punished. Hopefully this will mean their behaviour will start to improve.
{i}Should I keep listening or move on?{/i}
So did you watch the last episode of Love Archipelago?
Oooh I love that show...
{i}Fuck, they've started talking about reality TV. Time to move on.{/i}
{i}Oh it's Debbie. I wonder how she's feeling after her punishment.{/i}
{i}Let's see if I can listen in.{/i}
So what happened then?
Then Miss Newman spanked me!
Oh my God! You got spanked by Miss Newman. Don't you have a massive crush on her?
No I don't!
Is that why you can't stop staring at her in sports lessons and why you stutter like an idiot when she talks to you?
Shut up Cass, I'm not a lesbian!
