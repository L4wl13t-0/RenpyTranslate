{i}It's late now I should head home to bed.{/i}
{i}What a day. I wonder if every day here will be this eventful.{/i}
{i}The science teacher Miss Chang seems like an interesting woman.{/i}
{i}I wonder if allowing her to perform experiments in the school would be a bad idea. As long as the girls are not harmed I don't see the problem.{/i}
{i}The English teacher Claire seems nice but I fear she doesn't have the ability to control her class.{/i}
{i}I will need to do a lot of one-on-one training to get her up to speed on disciplining young women.{/i}
{i}The sports teacher Sally Newman is quite the woman. I think she may be open to using some more advanced disciplinary methods.{/i}
{i}I'll need to introduce her to them gradually though. I learnt my lesson after the conference that people might not understand straight away.{/i}
{i}I can tell that Ruth is going to be my main problem at this school. Hopefully I can find some way to deal with her.{/i}
{i}Things were so much easier for me at my old research position with Sarah and my other test subjects.{/i}
Yawn.
{i}Time for me to get some sleep.{/i}
Knock knock.
Come in.
Good afternoon sir.
Sarah, what are you doing here? It's Saturday.
I know, silly. I knew you'd be working so I came here to see you.
You came to see me?
You work way too hard. I think you need a break.
That's very sweet of you Sarah. Only I can't stop working right now.
The education secretary has invited me to speak at a conference next week and I have no idea how to present my ideas.
Wow. That sounds like a big deal.
It will be. A lot of very important people will be there.
I'm worried though that I won't be able to convince people about my theories.
My ideas are so radical. I fear I won't be able to adequately describe them.
Well, I think you're super smart. I'm sure you'll think of something.
Thank you Sarah. So what brings you here to see me?
You've been doing well in class lately and I have no reason to punish you.
It's not that. I came here to thank you.
You did?
Yes sir. I just got a conditional offer to go to university.
That's great news.
All I need to do is pass my exams. After all the extra study sessions you made me do I'm feeling confident.
Excellent. I am very proud of you.
You've helped me so much I wanted to thank you somehow.
No thanks necessary young lady. It's all in a day's work.
I don't know about that. None of my other teachers have ever cared so much about my behaviour.
No one ever really cared about anything I did before.
I should hate you for all the mean and humiliating things you've done to me.
For all the times you made me strip naked and spanked me or stuck things in my butt.
Or that time you forced your cock down my throat.
For some reason though, I don't. Ever since we started our sessions I've gotten so much better at my studies.
If it hadn't been for you then I would have failed school again.
Who knows what would have happened to me.
I feel like I'm a better person now and I realise that I have you to thank.
So please, let me do something to make it up to you.
Really Sarah. Your thanks is all the reward I need.
Are you sure? Is there nothing you'd like me to do for you?
Actually, now that you mention it, there is something you can do.
Anything for you sir. Anything at all.
