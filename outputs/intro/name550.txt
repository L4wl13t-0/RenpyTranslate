Oh... so like, why are you interrupting our conversation?
Just introducing myself. What's your name?
Cassandra.
You better watch your tone Cassandra or you'll end up in my office for punishment after school.
Ha. Like, whatever.
Good morning.
Good morning sir.
What's your name young lady?
Lucy Fletcher. It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too Lucy.
Sir, I was wondering if I could speak to you about something?
Of course what seems to be the trouble?
Erm... Well, it's a private matter...
I see, well come see me when I'm working in my office. My door is always open to my students.
Thank you! I will. See you later.
You are about to teach your first class.
During events such as teaching a class or patrolling the school you will often be presented with choices. These choices will affect how events play out and also which statistic points are awarded. The school statistics points can be shown or hidden using the arrow icon at the top left of the screen.
The green {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} stat represents how well the students are doing in their studies. The ultimate aim of the game is to get {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} as high as possible in order to prove yourself to the academic community.
The red {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} stat represents how well behaved and obedient the girls are. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} will automatically drop if {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} is low as the girls will not be studying after lessons.
The blue {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} stat represents how much the girls like you. If your {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} is high girls will come you with with their problems.
Given your unique methods of discipline you may over time raise the sexual tension in the school. This is represented by the pink {color=#df7ac4}Horniness{/color} statistic. This will affect the general behaviour of the girls and introduce new events.
Choices that have a positive effect on one stat may have a negative effect on others. The level of your statistics will effect your options during certain events.
Keep an eye on the statistics bar at the top of the screen. If either {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} or {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} fall to zero then you will lose the game.
You will now have your first choice and an opportunity to increase your stats. How would you like to introduce yourself to the class?
Good morning class. My name is Mr [surname] and I am your new headmaster.
You will find me to be a very strict disciplinarian.
Let me be very clear. This is not your typical school. All of you girls are here because you have either failed or been expelled from your final school year.
As such we have been granted special dispensation from both your parents and the government to enforce very strict discipline.
This includes the use of corporal punishment. Your old headmaster may have been afraid to dish out such punishments but be assured I have no such qualms.
Any of you girls sent to my office will learn that lesson the hard way.
You try to instil some fear into the class. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} has improved slightly as a result.
Good morning everyone. My name is Mr [surname], your new headmaster.
I know all of you girls had trouble at your previous schools, having either failed or been expelled. I will not judge you for anything that has happened in the past.
I am hoping that you will welcome the second chance that is being offered to you here.
I want you girls to know that I am here to help you if you have any problems at all. My office is always open to you.
As I'm sure you know this school has been granted special dispensation from both your parents and the government to enforce very strict discipline.
This includes the use of corporal punishment. I sincerely hope that such measures will be unnecessary.
You try to be reasonable with the class. Your {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} has improved slightly as a result.
As you leave your class you hear a woman's scream coming from the English classroom.
What was that? It came from Miss Potts' English class.
What the hell is going on here?
Why is Miss Potts soaking wet?
Oh my, and her shirt has become completely transparent.
Someone tell me who is responsible for this or so help me this whole class will be severely punished.
Debbie Harris threw a water balloon.
Fuck you Lucy. You're dead meat.
I don't see why we should all get punished because of you Debbie.
Debbie, what on earth possessed you to do such a thing?
We could all tell she wasn't wearing a bra under her shirt. I couldn't help myself.
You are in serious trouble young lady. Report to my office after class. I'll deal with you then.
