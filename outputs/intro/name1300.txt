Mmmmm...
Oooohhh...
Miss, I'm sorry I was bad.
What are you going to do with me?
Oh Miss Newman, please don't pull my knickers down.
Oh no, what are you doing now?
Don't put your fingers in there. Not with all these people watching...
Oh yes, finger me more Miss...
Yes, Yes, YES!
Ah....
{i}Wow, looks like she passed out. I should move on.{/i}
{i}Hmmmm... I can hear running water over this way.{/i}
{i}Ah, it's the girls' shower room. The window is frosted though so I can't see in.{/i}
{i}The bathroom could be a prime location for bad behaviour.{/i}
{i}I'll need to get this window open to check what the girls are up to.{/i}
{i}Should I try to open it or move on?{/i}
{i}There is a catch on the other side. If I have something long and thin I could slide it under and lift the catch.{/i}
{i}It's a good thing I picked up that ruler earlier.{/i}
{i}The catch is released. Now I just need to open it.{/i}
{i}Maybe if I look around I could find a stick.{/i}
{i}Ah, this stick will do.{/i}
Now to slide it under the window and flip the catch.
{i}There we go. That was a little too easy to break in.{/i}
{i}Ah, what an excellent view.{/i}
{i}The girls are just showering though and aren't doing anything badly behaved.{/i}
{i}Not sure what I was expecting.{/i}
{i}It would be far more convenient for me to simply set up cameras around the dorms to keep an eye on the girls.{/i}
{i}That way I can monitor their behaviour from the comfort of my office.{/i}
{i}I can't even get access to the building at the moment though. So setting up cameras will have to wait.{/i}
{i}Oh, I know her. That's the American girl from my sports class.{/i}
{i}I think she said her name was Charlotte.{/i}
{i}She is rather pretty, a little flat chested maybe but that's OK by me.{/i}
{i}I shall look forward to punishing her in my office soon.{/i}
{i}Wait what am I thinking?! I should be hoping the girls behave themselves. Not hoping they get in trouble.{/i}
Hey, is the window open?
{i}Ah shit.{/i}
Who opened the window?!
Faye, was it you?
It wasn't me this time, I promise!
Come on girls, you need to be more careful. Anyone could see in!
I'd better close it.
At least there's no one out there.
That perv Mr Wilson or that drunk groundskeeper could be watching.
Or the headmaster!
Exactly! We wouldn't want him to see us all in the shower.
{i}Damn, I won't get away with opening the window again this evening.{/i}
{i}Time to move on.{/i}
Hey, is someone out here?
{i}Shit better leave fast.{/i}
Huh, there's no one here. Must have been the wind.
