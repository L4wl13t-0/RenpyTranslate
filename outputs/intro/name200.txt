And then pull down her underwear.
Wait!
We can now see her adorable little vagina.
Sir please, I'll die of embarrassment.
Don't be so dramatic Sarah. You've been through this process before.
Yes but never in front of a crowd. People have their cameras out.
Excellent. That just shows how keen they are to learn my techniques.
There is something visually very pleasing about a naked young woman desperately trying to cover herself.
However, the objective here is to cause maximum embarrassment so the student shouldn't be allowed any modesty.
Hands behind your back Sarah.
Sirï¿½ Iï¿½
Sarah.
Please sirï¿½
Sometimes the student may refuse to obey your instructions.
It can be tempting to simply use force but it is important that the student comply on their own.
Sarah, I have been going easy on you as this is a demonstration.
Do you want this to become a real punishment?
No sirï¿½
You know very well I can make this much worse for you.
Yes sir.
Hands behind your back now before I lose my temper.
Yes sir.
Very good young lady.
Sarah's young body is now completely exposed and her humiliation is almost complete.
Go ahead and turn around again Sarah.
Um... OK.
Now bend over.
What?!
Go ahead and bend over.
But...they'll see everything!
Bend over, Sarah. That is an order.
Yes sir.
With Sarah in this lewd position she is completely vulnerable and, I dare say, totally humiliated.
Isn't that right Sarah?
Yes.
Yes what?
Yes sir.
Very good.
We can now move on to the third and final component of the [surname] method.
That component is pleasure.
Although it may seem counterintuitive to provide pleasure as part of a punishment.
I discovered that pleasure, particularly of a sexual nature, significantly enhanced the effectiveness of both the pain and humiliation.
More importantly it stops the punishment from becoming an entirely negative experience and ultimately leads to happier and more obedient students.
Pleasure can be provided in a number of ways.
For this demonstration I shall begin by lightly tracing my finger around the lips of her vagina.
Oh my gosh!
Now some of you may be thinking that this is a slightly inappropriate thing to be doing to one of your students.
I can understand that point of view entirely. I myself was a little apprehensive when I first started experimenting with this approach.
However, let me assure you the long-term benefits for the student far outweigh any discomfort you may be feeling.
Mmmmmï¿½
