Good day to you.
{i}Thank God she's gone. It seems like Ruth is going to be a serious problem for me.{/i}
{i}I won't be able to introduce my disciplinary methods if I am not allowed to punish the girls myself.{/i}
{i}Mr Mykock suggested I try to dig up some dirt on her.{/i}
{i}She doesn't seem like the type to have an incriminating past but you never know.{/i}
{i}I'll should ask around the school. See if anyone knows anything about her.{/i}
{i}Mr Mykock said that I would receive payment if the school's owners approved of my punishment.{i}
{i}I should check my emails.{i}
{i}Let me see here. A message from Mykock.{/i}
{i}It says the owners were very pleased.{/i}
{i}It says the owners were pleased with the punishment but that there is room for improvement.
{i}It says the owners are unimpressed and that I must do better.{/i}
{i}It says the owners are furious and are considering terminating my employment.{/i}
{i}They have added [earnings] credits into my account.{/i}
{i}Wow, these guys take their punishments very seriously.{/i}
Well done, you've earned some money. Use it to purchase items from the online store or to order upgrades to the school facilities from the construction menu. Both of which can be accessed through your computer.
You spend the next half an hour doing paperwork while Debbie stands in the corner.
OK Debbie. You can get dressed and go now.
Something you want to say?
No.
{i}It's difficult to say but I think we made some progress with Debbie today.{/i}
{i}Hopefully we can move on to more advanced punishments in our next session.{/i}
Fuck you dickhead.
{i}Hmmm... I don't think I made much progress with Debbie today.{/i}
{i}A punishment is only effective when it has maximum pain, humiliation and pleasure.{/i}
{i}I'll need to do better for future punishments.{/i}
Well done. You've maxed out Debbie's pain, humiliation and pleasure, increasing her to Level 2.
At her next level the targets will increase and you will find it harder to reach them. You will need to unlock new, more efficient items and actions if you are going to reach the next level.
This is as far as you can go for now though so when you are ready click 'End Punishment' to continue with the story. Or activate Free Play Mode and perform all the actions again.

Monday Evening
Hello again Mr [surname].
I hope you were able to teach that young lady a lesson. I'm sorry to say that punishing the girls is going to take up quite a bit of your time.
School is over for the day and you're free to do whatever you like in the evening.
However, Miss Chang left a message and asked for you to visit her in the science classroom.
Thanks Samantha. I've been looking forward to meeting Miss Chang. I'll head over there now.
OK sir. I'll be headed home now. See you in the morning.
Thank you for your help today and good night Samantha.
Good night Mr [surname].

I don't have time to go the gym right now. I need to meet Miss Chang in the science classroom.
I should go check in on the girls at the dorms.
{i}I do need to check in on the girls at the dorm but I should go visit Miss Chang first in the science classroom.
I don't have time to go visit the apartments right now. I need to meet Miss Chang in the science classroom.
{i}This is where the staff live. I can visit the staff another night. Tonight I think I'd rather check up on the students.{/i}
Hmmm... the gate leading to the lake seems to be locked. I'll have to raise this at the next board meeting.
{i}It's late and the class is empty.{/i}
{i}It's not too late, maybe I should head to the dorms to check up on the girls.{/i}
