{i}Holy crap it's the sports teacher, Miss Newman.{/i}
{i}What's she doing in the men's room?{/i}
{i}She taking off the rest of her clothes.{/i}
{i}Oh sweet Jesus.{/i}
{i}I should really let her know I'm in the room. I don't want to make a bad impression on my first day{/i}
Huh?
Oh Mr [surname]! You startled me.
I'm very sorry Miss Newman but you seem to be in the men's room.
Ah yes. I'm sorry about that.
We don't have staff changing rooms and I don't feel it's appropriate for me to get changed with the girls.
So I've been coming in here for months now.
There are pretty much no men at this school so I've always had this room to myself.
I should have remembered you were starting here today.
You don't mind though, do you? I can stop changing in here if you like?
I don't mind, you can change in here.
As long as you're not afraid of me walking in on you.
Oh that's OK, I used to be in the army and we had unisex changing all the time. I'm used to it.
Hmmmm... I see from the bulge in your trousers you aren't.
You should probably look the other way. We can't have you going out in front of the girls in that state can we?
Err...Right yes.
I'm going to finish changing now, I'll see you later Mr [surname].
See you later Miss Newman.
{i}Maybe I can watch for a little bit longer.{/i}
{i}Oh wow. What a gorgeous woman. She looks to be in fantastic shape.{/i}
Huh?
Mr [surname]! How long have you been standing there?
Oh, I just came a second ago.
You just came?!
Oh no, I mean I just came in!
So why were you just standing there?
I came here to change and this is the men's room. What are you doing in here?
I know this is the men's room.
We don't have staff changing rooms and I don't feel it's appropriate for me to get changed with the students.
There's virtually no men at this school so I've always had this room to myself.
I should have remembered you were starting here today. Although you could have told me you had walked in.
Oh err... sorry. I err...
So I'm completely naked. Could you just wait outside for a minute please while I put some clothes on?
Right yes very sorry.
{i}She seems quite annoyed I probably should have said I was in the room...{/i}
You wait a few minutes until you hear Sally call you back in.
I'm sorry about that. I didn't mean for us to get off on the wrong foot.
I am in the wrong room so the fault is mine.
No, it's my fault. I shouldn't have just stood there.
Well no harm done really. When I was in the army we had mixed sex changing quite often. I'm actually quite used to it.
You don't mind if I keep changing in here do you?
No that's fine.
Great, thanks. See you around Mr [surname].
You get changed and head out to the gymnasium. A group of girls are already there waiting for you.
Good afternoon girls.
Girls" "Good afternoon sir.
