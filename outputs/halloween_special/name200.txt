Oh, um... That does sound better than streaking naked.
Damn it, I'm out. I've got nothing left to give them.
Sorry girls, I'm actually completely out of candy now.
Oh no.
Come on Rachel, let's see how the others are doing.
Open up your tops and I'll spare you a little extra.
Can we have more sweets now please?
A deals a deal. Here you go, girls.
Thanks sir! Hopefully, this will be enough not to lose.
Come on Rachel, let's see how the others are doing.
Sorry girls, I need to save the rest of my candy.
Oh no.
Come on Rachel, let's see how the others are doing.
Knock knock
Mr [surname], we've got the least sweets. Can we have some more?
More? Why would I do that?
Please. I can't lose to Charlotte, I'll never hear the end of it.
Well, you know what Charlotte offered me?
No?
She offered to flash her boobs for extra.
No way! What a slut! No wonder she's ahead.
If we show you our boobs can we have more as well?
We've both got way nicer boobs than Charlotte does. Especially Alice, have you seen how big they are?
Damn it, I'm out. I've got nothing left to give them.
Sorry girls, I'm actually completely out of candy now.
Show me the goods and the sweets are yours.
A deals a deal. Here you go girls.
Thanks sir! Hopefully, this will be enough not to lose.
Come on Alice, let's see how the others are doing.
Sorry girls, I need to save the rest of my candy.
Shit.
Come on Alice, let's find the others.
Knock knock
What the fuck sir, there are girls with more sweets than us!
Don't make us egg your house, old man.
Listen, girls, extortion will only get you so far in life.
Some of the other girls have offered to give me a little treat instead of just threatening me.
What kind of treat?
Just a quick flash of their boobs.
You're asking schoolgirls to show you their boobs in exchange for sweets?! What a bloody pervert. We should egg your house right now.
Come on Cass, just give him a quick flash. Let's not waste the eggs. 
Damn it, I'm out. I've got nothing left to give them.
Sorry girls, I'm actually completely out of candy now.
Show me the goods and the sweets are yours.
A deals a deal. Here you go, girls.
That's better. Alright, we'll go.
Come on Cass, let's see how the others are doing.
Sorry girls, I need to save the rest of my candy.
Shit.
Come on Cass, let's find the others.
