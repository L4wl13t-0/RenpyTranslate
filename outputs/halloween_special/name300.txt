Oh god, this is the worst. April is never going to let me hear the end of it!
This is so embarrassing! Why did I agree to this?
Looking good girls!
It seems several girls are tied for last place.
Who has to do the forfeit then?
I don't know. I guess if there's no clear loser then no one has to streak.
Oh thank goodness. I was so worried.
Damn it I was too stingy some of the girls tied. I should have made sure only one team had just one handful of candy.
Game over! Want to try again?
Well, wasn't that a fun Halloween.
Well done for finding all the endings! Have a great Halloween from Altos and Herdone.
Want to play again?
Thanks for playing our little mini-game. Try to get all the endings for an extra bonus picture. Want to start again?
What's that sound?
I'm being egged!
Oh the humanity!
Game over! Want to try again?
