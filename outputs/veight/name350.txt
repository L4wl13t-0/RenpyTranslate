Goodnight [cname].
I should sit in on Claire's class today to see if she has the opportunity to spank one of the girls.
Hopefully she remembers everything I taught her and she doesn't lose control of herself this time.
Good morning Miss Potts.
Good afternoon Miss Potts.
Hello Mr [surname]. I thought you might stop by class today. Please take a seat at my desk.
Thank you, Miss Potts. Please carry on with class as normal and pretend I'm not here.
Yes Mr [surname].
OK class, let's continue with our lesson on early 20th-century poetry.
An hour later.
Well that's all we have time for today. Please can you hand in your assignments on the way out and I'll see you all tomorrow.
Hi Miss Potts.
Hello Mary.
Um, about my homework.
Yes.
I was hoping it would be OK to hand it in tomorrow morning?
The deadline is today.
I know but I had some computer trouble last night and I was hoping that you would let me hand it in late. Like you did before?
Because I was lenient with you before you decided to take advantage of my forgiving nature?
What?! No Miss, I just thought...
You thought that I'm a pushover and you could get away without doing my homework on time?
No!
You thought, ï¿½Silly Miss Potts. She's so soft, she won't punish me?'
No Miss wait, I think there has been a misunderstanding. If you would just let me explain.
Oh no Mary, I am understanding you perfectly well. I have had it up to here with you girls treating me like a joke.
It's time that I started taking a more hands-on approach to your discipline.
Take your skirt off and bend over my desk.
Hmmmm... Claire is getting angry already and she hasn't given Mary a proper chance to explain herself.
Mary will end up resenting her teacher if she isn't given a fair say. Claire should at least listen to her excuse before jumping to punishment. This is not off to a good start.
No wait, please Miss. My computer...
No excuses Mary! Skirt off now!
But Miss...
Fine, I'll do it for you.
No stop.
Oh dear me, Claire is resorting to force already. This is not how a punishment should be at all. It is vital that the student complies on their own.
Now get down over that desk.
But Miss Potts let me explain...
I'm running out of patience Mary.
Please don't spank me, Miss, this isn't fair.
Ow! my ear!
I've had enough of this. Get over my desk this instant.
Ow! Stop it you're hurting me.
Yes Mary, that's exactly what I'm doing and I'm going to hurt you even more.
Get down there.
Ooofff.
Ow Miss! Please stop!
Slap
Ouch!
Don't you ever disrespect me again by not bothering to do my homework.
But Miss I... I did do it, I just...
