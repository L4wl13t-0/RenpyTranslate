Well, that was the whole point of doing this so I guess it would be wrong to wake her up.
I'm pretty sleepy too after that orgasm. I'll just close my eyes for a minute and...
knock knock
knock knock knock knock.
Rachel, are you sleeping?! It's time for breakfast.
Huh...
Can I come in?
Oh gosh!
I'm coming in now.
No stop!
Are you OK? What are you doing in there?
I'm, errr...
MASTURBATING!
Oh! Um... OK.
Don't take too long we were all going to go for a walk down to the lake, remember?
Don't take too long. Classes start soon.
OK thanks, Faye.
That was close!
Quick, you better get dressed and go.
Yes, of course.
But wait one second. Before you go I want to give you something.
What's that?
Mwahh.
That was for giving me my first orgasm. It was very special.
Thanks Rachel.
No go on, quickly before anyone sees you.
Don't worry. I'll be headed out. See you later, Rachel.
You spend the period teaching the girls history. All the girls seem to be paying attention. Grades +2.
Even Rachel looks bright-eyed and bushy-tailed today.
It looks like Rachel got a good night's sleep last night. I wonder if this means she is cured of her late-night gaming addiction now.
OK, girls that's all we have time for today. Don't forget your homework assignments and I'll see you all tomorrow.
Hey Rachel, you play that World of Fantasy MMO right?
Yeah.
Did you hear about the new DLC?
What no?
Yeah, apparently the developers are trying to increase sales by adding a bunch of adult content to the game.
Adult content? The game is already rated 18 and it has full nudity in it.
Boys are always trying to knock my characters armour off.
Yeah I know but now they are adding actual sex.
Really?!
Yeah, like, really pervy stuff. If you lose in combat then the winner can do naughty things to you.
Wow.
Sex?! Oh my God. That seems like a pretty low way to try and make money off of a computer game. The developers must be really desperate for sales.
I don't know, I'm actually kind of curious. Do you think I could see you play it?
I don't even have the new DLC.
I read you don't need to pay for it right now, you just need to opt-in on the server.
I don't know. I don't think I want to see sex in my game.
Why?
My character Aisha is a beautiful and noble, cat-girl, warrior princess. She wouldn't sleep around with anyone.
Oh well, fair enough. I can probably watch a lets-play online somehow.
