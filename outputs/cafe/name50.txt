The cafe is closed at night.
The cafeterina is still under construction. It should be finished soon.
The cafeteria construction has been compelted.
I still need to figure out who is going to run the kitchen though.
Samantha is a local. I should be sure to speak with her about any restaurants in the local area.
I'm sure the right candidate will appear eventually.
I have a restuarant manager now so I just need to wait for the construction to be completed.
This is just a placeholder. Scenes for the cafe will be added soon.
