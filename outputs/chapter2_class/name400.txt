Faye, what was the name of the mystical adviser in the court of Nicholas II, who's terrible reputation may have helped to precipitate the overthrow of the tsar?
Oh um...
I'll give you a musical hint.
There lived a certain man in Russia long ago, he was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow. Ra ra...
Lenin?
No! Rasputin. Good lord. Once again, you've failed to remember anything I've taught you. I'm sorry, Faye, but I'm going to have to punish you.
Oh dear.
See me in my office after school young lady. I will decide on your punishment then. Let's try to carry on with the lesson.
You resolved to deal with the girl in your office after school. The lesson continues without further interruption. However, Faye's poor memory is dragging down the average and {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} do not improve.
Come up to the front of the class young lady.
I'm going to let you off with a warning this time, Faye. Just try harder to remember this stuff, please, and also go listen to some Boney M.
Who?
You decide to let it slide this one time. The girls appreciate you being lenient {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} + 1. However, this sets a very bad example {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} -1 and Faye's poor memory is dragging down the average grade. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} -1.
In accordance with the school rules please remove your tie and skirt.
Yes sir.
Now remove your shirt.
Bend over the lectern facing the blackboard so the class can get a good view of your bottom being spanked.
Yes sir.
OK Faye, are you ready?
I guess.
OK good, here we go.
Ouch!
There. Now go and stand in the corner facing the wall until the end of the lesson.
OK class, now where was I...
You give the girl a sound thrashing and the girls learn the importance of remembering what you teach them. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +3. However, the interruption prevented you from completing your lesson, and Faye's poor memory is dragging down the average grades {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} -1.
You give the girl a sound thrashing and the girls learn the importance of remembering what you teach them. They felt especially sorry for Faye as she had to strip down to her underwear {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +4. However, the interruption prevented you from completing your lesson, and Faye's poor memory is dragging down the average grades {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} -1.
Faye, you must be punished for this behaviour. However, I do not wish to interrupt my lesson with a lengthy spanking.
As a quick and effective punishment you are required to remove all clothing from above the waist for the remainder of the lesson.
Everything?! Even my bra.
Yes, everything. The punishment would not be effective otherwise.
Um...
Stand up Faye and take off your shirt.
Oh gosh.
How are you feeling Faye?
Embarrassed.
Good. Hopefully this will encourage you to try harder next lesson.
Now sit down and pay attention. Try writing things down if you can't remember them.
Yes sir.
You punished Faye by making her sit topless for the remainder of the lesson. The effect on Discipline is much less than that for a spanking, however, the disruption was minimal and you got your full lesson taught. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +1 {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +2.
You are teaching the girls history and they are mostly paying attention.
You spot Rachel falling asleep again.
Rachel, wake up!
Eeeek!
See me in my office after school young lady.
Yes sir.
You resolve to deal with the girl in your office after school. The girls reluctantly settled down and class continues without further interruption. You manage to get most of your lesson completed. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +1.
I'll give you a warning this time, Rachel. Don't let me see you sleeping in class again.
Yes sir, thank you sir!
