You are free to remove your cardigans, as you all have done already.
However, shirts that are untucked or not buttoned up correctly I will consider to be non-regulation clothing and, as such, they may be confiscated.
Seriously?
Yes, I'm afraid so. You think I want to be wearing long trousers and a shirt today?
I don't know. Do you?
No, I do not. However as the headmaster I must remain smartly dressed and I expect the same of my students.
Just think yourselves lucky you have skirts on instead of trousers.
Now, in today's lesson we will be moving on from Napoleon to the Russian Revolution of 1917.
Oh thank God. Feels like we've been learning about Napoleon forever.
Quiet Cassandra.
At the turn of the twentieth century Russia was ruled by Tsar Nicolas the Second. An autocratic monarch who attempted to control his population through fear and intimidation.
That sounds familiar.
Something to say, Cassandra?
We've been learning a lot about oppressive regimes lately.
Was that a joke? Are you implying something about the way I run this school?
What do you think?
I think you are seriously playing with fire, young lady.
Now, cut the bad attitude, be quiet and pay attention.
Yes, Tsar [surname].
Right, that does it. See me in my office after class.
You just can't help yourself can you, Cassandra? You just have to be rude, even to someone who is trying to help you.
Your bad attitude towards your teachers still persists despite all the spankings you've been given.
Think yourself lucky we are starting a new subject today and I have a lot of lesson to cover. Otherwise, I'd give you the paddle right now in front of all your classmates.
Also, I've been looking forward to spanking Cassandra for a long time. I think I'll do it in my office where I can take my time and really savour the experience.
Since I need to focus on the girls' grades, it would be useful to have a way to punish the girls in class quickly without the disruption of a lengthy spanking.
Perhaps simply by making them expose themselves in some way, to humiliate them.
They already need to remove their skirts during punishment. However, making them take off their skirts won't be effective as they will be exposed beneath their desks.
I could punish girls by having them sit through lessons in just their underwear. Although, that might not be effective enough.
No. I think to really embarrass the girls they would need to sit through class with nothing on at all above the waist.
I used this punishment once before for Alice but I think I was probably pushing the limits of my authority at the time. I should definitely make it an official school policy to avoid any problems.
A new rule is available to vote on at the school board.
OK girls, now please pay close attention.
You resolved to deal with Cassandra after school and you completed your lesson without any further interruptions. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +1.
OK class, last lesson I asked you to read the chapter of your text books on Tsar Nicholas II.
Who can tell me how long he served as Emperor of Russia?
Me sir!
Priti.
He ruled from November 1894 until his abdication in March 1917.
Yes, very good.
Priti really is an excellent student. There is no need for her to be at this school. She should be at university already.
The school's owners want to see her being punished but I have no reason to.
Although, that said, everyone has their faults and weaknesses. Priti needs no help with her work ethic, but perhaps there is some other aspect of her behaviour that needs improving.
I should watch out for her as I patrol the schools grounds.
The lesson goes very smoothly and it helps to have a bright and attentive girl like Priti in your class. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +3.
Now girls, as I was saying last lesson...
Right, who threw that?!
Oh my, judging by the look of surprise on the student's faces it looks like Priti has decided to take my advice and break the rules.
This is a great moment for Priti. Her first step in learning to rebel against the authority figures in her life and to be her own person.
It's almost a shame that I have to punish her now.
Priti, was that you?
