I recognise certain patterns in your behaviour, Liz.
I think I know what's distracting you and I would like to help you.
Help me?
Yes, but first I need you to start being completely honest. I need you to be yourself around me.
How's that, sir?
You can start by lifting up your skirt.
Mr [surname]!
Don't play coy, Liz. I know you dropped your pen on purpose.
You were hoping that I would see between your legs.
Do you deny it?
Um... No.
Well, I'm giving you another opportunity to expose yourself to me. Tell the truth, you want to, don't you?
Yes.
Then lift up your skirt.
Yes sir.
Good girl.
Now we can start to have an honest conversation.
Being seen naked turns you on, doesn't it?
Yes sir.
You've spent my lesson fantasising about exposing yourself, haven't you?
Yes sir.
How much of the work I set this lesson did you complete?
Barely any.
Just as I thought.
Stand closer to me, girl. Keep your skirt up.
Is that close enough, Mr [surname]?
Yes, now tell me what you were you fantasising about when you were supposed to be working?
I... I can't.
Why not?
I'm too embarrassed, sir.
You want to tell me though, don't you?
Um...Maybe.
Hmmm... Perhaps you just need to be in the right frame of mind.
Come here.
Sir!
What... What are you doing?
I think a little sexual stimulation might help you open up to me.
Oh my goodness! Sir, you shouldn't touch me there.
Do you want me to stop?
No.
But sir, is there another class coming?
Perhaps there is.
But, they'll see us!
Oh sir!
They might. Someone could walk through that door at any moment. The thought excites you, does it not?
Yes!
Now tell me, what you were thinking about? What kept your mind from your school work?
I was fantasising about walking in the woods with no clothes on.
I... I was imagining what it would be like to be naked outside and...
What it would be like getting caught by other people.
