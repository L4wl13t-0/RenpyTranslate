You are teaching the girls history and dictating some notes.
You notice that Liz appears distracted.
Liz!
Sir?
Are you paying attention?
Err... Yeah.
It didn't look like it to me. You appeared to be daydreaming.
Sorry sir.
Care to tell the class what you were thinking about?
No!
Stay focused, Liz, or I will have to punish you in front of everyone. Is that what you want to happen?
Um...
Well?
No. No, of course not.
Then please stay focused.
Yes sir.
Liz hesitated there for a moment. I wonder if she would have behaved differently if she was more horny.
A horniness level of 6 or more (and the ability to remove the girls shirts during punishment) is required to make progress with Liz.
The lesson continued but Liz's lack of focus prevented her from taking in all the information. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +1.
The girls are busy revising for their upcoming exams.
You notice that Liz looks rather distracted.
Oops.
Mr [surname], I dropped my pen.
Thank you, sir.
Mmmmm... That is a nice view.
Oh my.
It's seemed like Liz was hoping to give me a show.
What a naughty girl.
First she admitted to her friends that she enjoys the thrill of walking around with no underwear.
Now she has progressed to exposing her genitalia in public.
I think it's time I had a little chat with Liz about her exhibitionist tendencies.
Whilst I enjoy seeing the sight of a beautiful young woman proudly revealing an intimate part of her body.
I cannot allow her sexual exploration to become a distraction from her school work.
I will need to find her a healthy outlet for her desire to be seen naked.
There you are, Liz.
Thank you very much, sir.
No, thank you.
The lesson continued uninterrupted. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +2.
OK, girls that's all the time we have today. You may leave now.
Not you though, Liz. We need to talk.
What can I do for you, Mr [surname].
Liz, I've noticed that you seem a little distracted in class lately.
Do I, sir?
Yes. I've noticed you fidgeting and your attention often seems to be elsewhere.
Tell me where your mind wanders in those moments?
I'm focused on my studies, sir.
Is that so? I believe that you have been daydreaming. Perhaps you would care to tell me what you've been thinking about?
You wouldn't understand, sir.
You girls might think of me as a boring old man with no understanding of what goes through a young woman's head.
However, that is not the case. I happen to be one the country's foremost experts in young adult psychology.
