You also sensed that some of the girls were happy to see you take the bully, Cassandra, down a peg. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +1.
As a quick and effective punishment I am ordering you to remove all clothing from above the waist for the remainder of the lesson.
Of course you are. Bloody pervert.
Stand up, Cassandra, and take off your shirt.
Yeah yeah, take a good look everyone. You don't see tits this great every day.
Happy now?
How are you feeling Cassandra?
Pissed off.
Well don't forget that smile, young lady. You need to learn to have one at all times even under difficult circumstances.
There, that's better.
God, I hate you so much.
Just sit down and focus on your work, Cassandra. You've wasted enough of everyone's time already.
You punished Cassandra by making her sit topless for the remainder of the lesson. The effect on Discipline is much less than that for a spanking, however, the disruption was minimal and you got your full lesson taught. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +1 {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +2.
OK class, I gave you fair warning that Friday afternoons I would be doing a pop quiz to make sure you are studying hard enough for your exams.
I'm now going to ask one of you a question. Get it wrong and you will be punished.
OK, now who to ask...
How about you, Priti?
I'm ready sir.
What major political event took place in France prior to Napoleon's rise to power?
The French revolution, sir. That was an easy one.
Yes. Well done, Priti.
The girls appreciate you giving an easy question and feel more confident that most of them knew the answer. However, a question this easy breeds complacency and grades do not improve much. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +2 {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +1.
What date did Napoleon sell the territory of Louisiana to the United States?
It was April 11, 1803, sir.
Well done, Priti, that was a tough one but you got it.
Thank you, sir.
You asked a hard but fair question and the girls understand the level of knowledge they need to attain. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +3.
What was the name of Napoleons horse?
Oh err... Thats not on the syllabus, is it? I... I... I don't know, sir.
It was Marengo.
Oh dear Priti, I'm afraid you must be punished.
Goodness me.
You asked an impossibly hard question that no one could be expected to answer. The girls are resentful and this does not encourage them to study. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} -3.
How about you, Rachel?
I've been studying hard, Mr [surname]. I'm ready.
Oh gosh...
Who crowned Napoleon Emperor of France?
Oh, I know that, he crowned himself.
He did. Well done Rachel.
Thank you, sir.

Napoleon first made a name for himself as a military leader at the siege of what French city?
I know! It's Toulon.
Well done, Rachel. That was a tough one and you got it right. You see what you can achieve when you stop staying up late playing video games.
Yay!

I don't know, sir.
Sorry Rachel, but you couldn't answer and you must be punished.
Oh dear.
