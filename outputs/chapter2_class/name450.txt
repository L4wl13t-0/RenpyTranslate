Yes sir.
Now remove your shirt.
Oh, um... But sir...
No excuses, Rachel, take your shirt off immediately.
Bend over the lectern facing the blackboard so the class can get a good view of your bottom being spanked.
Yes sir.
OK Rachel, here we go.
Ouch!
There. Now go and stand in the corner facing the wall until the end of the lesson.
OK class, now where was I...

They felt especially sorry for Rachel as she had to strip down to her underwear {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +4. However, the interruption prevented you from completing your lesson {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} -1.
Rachel, you must be punished for this behaviour. However, I do not wish to interrupt my lesson with a lengthy spanking.
As a quick and effective punishment you are required to remove all clothing from above the waist for the remainder of the lesson.
Oh gosh.
Stand up, Rachel, and take off your shirt.
Yes sir.
Everyone is staring at me.
Yes, everyone is watching to see you humiliated Rachel. This will be a good deterrent to future failure.
OK Rachel, now sit down and pay attention. Lets carry on with the lesson.
You punished Rachel by making her sit topless for the remainder of the lesson. The effect on Discipline is much less than that for a spanking, however, the disruption was minimal and you got your full lesson taught. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +1 {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +2.
You are teaching the girls history when you spot Cassandra playing on her phone.
Cassandra!
Yes, Mr [surname].
What have I told you about using your phone in class?
Relax, sir. You should learn to smile a little more. Then you won't come across as such a dickhead.
I'm glad you've listen to some of my advice Cassandra, but unfortunately we still have a lot of work left to do improving your bad attitude.
What?!
Seriously Cassandra, your bad attitude is just holding you back in life. Things would be so much easier for you if you just showed a little respect to your teachers.
See me in my office after school young lady. I will decide on your punishment then. Let's try to carry on with the lesson.
Yeah, whatever.
You resolved to deal with the girl in your office after school. The lesson continues without further interruption. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +1.
I'm going to let you off with a warning this time. Just try to pay attention and show a little more respect in the future.
Yeah, whatever.
You decide to let it slide this one time. The girls appreciate you being lenient {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} + 1. However, this sets a very bad example {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} -1.
Come up to the front of the class young lady.
Oh, for fucks sake.
Cassandra, in accordance with the school rules you must now remove your tie and skirt.
Now remove your shirt.
Whatever.
Let's just get this over with.
Such defiance, Cassandra.
I think I'll have to spank you in a position more fitting to your childish attitude.
Perhaps putting you over my knee might bring you more down to size.
You what?!
Not keen on the idea of being spanked like a naughty little girl in front of all your peers? Well, then this will do you some good. Let me grab a chair.

You gave Cassandra a humiliating spanking over your knee. The other girls were keen to avoid the same fate. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +3. However, the interruption prevented you from completing your lesson.
You also sensed that some of the girls were happy to see you take the bully, Cassandra, down a peg. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +1.
