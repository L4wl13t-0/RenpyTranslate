Debbie, you are to lay yourself across my lap.
Across your lap?!
Oh yes. Miss Newman has been performing admirably but it's time for me to take a more active role in your punishments.
But you're a man, it's not right that you should be touching me like that...
I am your headmaster and it is my responsibility to ensure you are suitably punished.
But I'm not going to punish you with all those clothes in the way. Strip.
I have to lay across your lap with no clothes on?
