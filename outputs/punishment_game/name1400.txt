Yes Debbie.
Oh my god, you're such a pervert.
These rules are decided by the school board Debbie don't blame me for them.
You must have talked them into it somehow. The old headmaster never made me take off my bra in front of him.
The old headmaster was not as strict as I am.
OK Debbie, here's the t-shirt. Go ahead and put it on.
Urrggh, I hate this stupid shirt.
Sir, the other girls all laugh at me in this. Can't I wear something else?
Nope, this is for your own good Debbie. A bit of humiliation builds character. Now, go on, get out of here.
Grrrrr....
Yeah and still nothing you can do about it.
For now Debbie. Go on put the t-shirt on.
Urrggh, I hate this stupid shirt.
Do I really have to wear this?
Of course. Now go on, get out of here.
Grrrr....
I'm going to need you to wear this t-shirt Debbie. Go ahead and put it on.
What here?
Yes Debbie. I can't have you wandering off without changing otherwise how will I know you don't just keep wearing your current clothes.
Um... OK I guess.
Well, hang on a second there young lady.
Sir?
You are wearing a red bra?
Um...
You know what I'm going to say next.
That you need to confiscate it?
Of course.
Good girl Debbie. You know your behaviour and attitude really has improved dramatically these last few weeks.
Here is the t-shirt. Go ahead and put it on.
Yes sir.
What the hell?! Sir?! 
What's the matter Debbie, something wrong?
Yeah, it spells out 'slag'! That's what you'd call, like, a really dirty prostitute.
I'm not walking around with this on!
You don't have a choice I'm afraid. If you find it embarrassing then don't repeat your bad behaviour.
Fuck!
Go on, get out of here Debbie. Before I punish you further for swearing.
Yes sir.
Well, hang on a second there young lady.
Sir?
You are wearing a red bra?
Um...
You know what I'm going to say next.
That you need to confiscate it?
Of course.
Good girl Debbie. You know your behaviour and attitude really has improved dramatically these last few weeks.
Here is the t-shirt. Go ahead and put it on.
Yes sir.
Do I really have to do this?
Yes Debbie, go on.
