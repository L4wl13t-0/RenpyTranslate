Yay!
I should get going sir and do my punishment.
Yes, but don't forget to put the t-shirt on.
Haha, yes silly me.
OK, see you later sir.
Ha, I'm guessing from her lack of reaction she is not familiar with the word written across her chest.
I'm sure she'll figure it out soon.
Sorry Rachel, but that's just my personal preference. I sure there are a lot of men out there who would like them though.
Hmmm... I think I may have ruined any chance I have of helping Rachel overcome her problems.
Oh...
You'll want me to take my shirt off again I suppose.
Of course.
OK then.
OK then.
I know you like my boobs so I won't try to hide them this time.
Well done, I'm glad to see you are more confident about your body.
Here is the t-shirt.
Thanks.
Erm, sir.
Yes?
when I wore the t-shirt last time all the girls were laughing at me.
I know it spells out the school's initials but I looked it up on Urban Dictionary and it also spells a dirty word.
Does it?
Yes, it's a derogatory word for a promiscuous woman sir.
Kind of a bit like slut or whore.
Is it now?
I thought you should know because people might get the wrong idea when they read it on our chests.
The other girls were saying some pretty rude things to me.
That is an unfortunate coincidence about the school's name. However, you are being punished Rachel.
It's not supposed to be fun for you.
Oh, I see...
Well, go on, put on the shirt and get going.
Yes sir.
I'll get going then.
Change into this t-shirt and get going.
Yes sir.
Erm, sir.
Yes Rachel.
