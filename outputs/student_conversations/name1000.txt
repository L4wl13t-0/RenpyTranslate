Sure, why not. Although, I fear those so-called celebrity contestants might be so stupid it's contagious.
I hate to think what that show might be doing to your developing brains.
Stupidity isn't contagious, Mr [surname].
I must strongly disagree with you there, Liz.
So do you want me to lift my skirt up for you today, sir?
Have you found any replacements yet for your blue-stained underwear?
No sir. I've got nothing on under my skirt.
Well, I would be extremely negligent in my duties if I didn't check that for myself.
Please raise your skirt and also open up your shirt.
Yes sir.
Excellent. I am always glad to see a student doing their best to comply with the rules under difficult circumstances.
Thank you, sir.
Oh my goodness, Liz, you've got no knickers on!
It's great, Rachel, you should try it. Feels nice and cool in this hot weather.
Really? That does sound good but I'd be too embarrassed.
Well done, Liz. You can drop your skirt now.
Ok sir.
Liz, are you are aware of the new rules regarding body searches?
Yes sir. I have to open up my shirt and lift my skirt up for a search, isn't that right?
That is correct, young lady.
OK then.
Now hands up against the locker and lean forward.
Yes sir.
Let's start off with your socks.
Am I leaning forward enough, sir?
Hmmmm... Maybe not.
Is that better?
A little.
How about now?
Much better.
Thank you for complying so willingly with your search.
No problem sir.
Alright, let's check your shirt.
Seems to be OK.
Now your bra...
Mmmmm...
Ah yes, of course you aren't wearing one.
How could you forget that?
Alright, Liz, its seems you aren't carrying any contraband.
You can get dressed now. I shall let you get on with your business.
Thank you sir. See you later.
I'll see you later, Liz.
You don't want to check my knickers?
Not today, Liz. I'll see you later.
See you later, sir.
Good morning, Emily.
Good morning, sir.
Managed not to trap your skirt today I see?
Yes sir.
I'm good, thanks. Miss Potts asked me to help out with costumes for the new school play.
