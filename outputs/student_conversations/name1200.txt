Ouch, ow gosh.
What's the matter with you, Rachel? Why are you getting so worked up when I body search the other girls?
I don't like it when you touch the other girl's bodies, Master.
Why? Are you jealous?
Um...
I thought you'd gotten over your body envy, Rachel? You're a cat, remember? Cats don't care about such things.
Ow... I'm not jealous of their bodies anymore.
Then what's the problem?
I... It's well...
Come on my pet, you can tell me.
No, I don't want to.
Holding things back from your Master? We can't have that. I think a little pleasure along with the pain might help loosen your tongue.
Drop your skirt and knickers.
Yes Master.
Ah...
Now tell me what's bothering you. Why are you upset?
I...
Ah... Goodness Master...
Tell me everything, Rachel.
You... You can touch me whenever you want so why do you want to feel all the other girlï¿½s bodies?
I'm your pet so you should only be touching me!
I see. That's the way you feel, is it?
Ah yes, everything makes sense now.
I already know that Rachel is a jealous person by nature.
She suffers from intense body envy and it seems that her jealousy towards other women extends to sharing me as well.
I suppose that makes a lot of sense. It's only natural that she feels a strong bond with her Master.
Watching me feeling the other girl's bodies is triggering her deep-seated insecurities and feelings of inadequacy when compared to other women.
Seeing me fondling Alice's ample breasts must have been the last straw.
This situation needs to be resolved quickly. If Rachel is going to be my pet then she is going to watch me do a lot more than just searching the other girls.
She needs to learn sooner rather than later that she's my plaything, not the other way around.
You mustnï¿½t be jealous, Rachel. I have to search the other students as part of my job.
Plus you know I have to strip, spank and touch the other girls during punishments. That's just part of being a headmaster.
You need to get control of your envy towards other women.
Oooohhh... Master. I'm sorry I try but I... I can't help it.
Aw, you poor sweet thing. You can't help it can you?
No Master.
Your envy towards other women runs very deep.
Since you've finally been honest with me I won't punish you any further today.
Um... It's OK Master. You can keep punishing me.
No Rachel, clearly you need more behavioural therapy but I need time to think about the best way to help you overcome your jealousy.
Oh, um... Are you sure Master? Don't you need to spank me?
You don't need a spanking right now, Rachel, what you need is a hug.
Come here.
Thank you, Master.
I love hugs.
So you're not angry with me?
No, of course not, Rachel. I can't be mad at you for feeling you have no control over.
We'll just need to find a way to help you manage your jealousy issue.
Hmmm... I need Rachel to get used to the idea of me being with other women.
She needs to learn that I'm not hers alone and that she will need to share. Otherwise, this feeling of jealousy could start to distract her from her studies.
