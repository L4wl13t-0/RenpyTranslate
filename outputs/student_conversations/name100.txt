There aren't many options open for a young woman to make money.
The athletics board should have been more understanding of your situation.
Thank you sir that's very kind of you. You're not a bad guy really when you're not giving out punishments.
Thanks.
You won't tell the other girls about this will you? It's kind of embarrassing.
Don't worry Amy. Your secret is safe with me.
Anyway don't let me keep you. You better get your uniform on and get ready for class.
Yes sir. Thank you. See you later.
Could this magazine be a cause of constant humiliation for Amy? Enough to interfere with my punishment methods?
I don't think I'll know until I've seen them for myself.
I wonder if I can find those pictures on the internet.
Maybe I should have a quick search when I'm next in the office.
How's it going Amy?
Good, thanks sir.
You keeping those abs well defined?
Yes sir.
Look.
Impressive.
Do you want to feel how hard they are too?
Oh yes. Very firm.
Thanks sir! I do my best.
Anyway, I better go get changed into my uniform before I'm late for class.
No problem, Amy. See you later.
That's OK Amy. I can tell how impressive they are without feeling them.
Oh, OK.
Well I'd better be off. I need to get my uniform on ASAP.
Hi there.
...
What's your name young lady?
Nina.
Nice to meet you Nina. Can you tell me a little about yourself?
Erm... No.
No? What's the matter are you shy?
No. I just don't want to talk to you.
I'm only making polite conversation.
Look, I'd just like to be on my own OK?
I'm sorry Nina but as the headmaster I would like to get to know all my students.
Well I'm not interested in getting to know anyone at this stupid school.
That is a poor attitude to take, young lady.
This school is not stupid. It was created to help troubled girls like you.
I'm not troubled!
Well what are you doing at this school then?
...
Did you fail your exams or were you expelled?
...
What can you tell me about your old school?
I didn't burn it!
Erm... Sorry?
Just leave me alone!
Hmmm... Nina seems like she may have a few issues. I should keep an eye on her.
