I just like to have it with me.
Let me see it.
She's right. There's no lighter fluid. Right now it's just a harmless piece of metal.
It's old and finely engraved. I can see this being something precious.
Please can I have it back, sir?
Yes. Fine. I won't take a harmless keepsake from your grandfather.
Thank you, sir.
OK, well you don't have any drugs on you at least.
You can get dressed now and go Nina. Think yourself lucky I'm not punishing you for trying to conceal something from me.
Yes sir. Thank you sir.
You let Nina keep a precious heirloom from her grandfather despite it being a banned item. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +2, {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} -1.
Sorry Nina, but I can't allow something like this in school.
I will keep this safe in the desk drawer in my office until the end of the year.
Don't worry. It will be safe in my possession.
Sir please...
Sorry Nina. Rules are rules.
You can get dressed now and go. Think yourself lucky I'm not punishing you for trying to conceal something from me.
Lucky? I don't feel lucky.
You took away Nina's treasured heirloom from her grandfather. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} -1, {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +2.
Sorry Nina, but I'm going to need to search you again.
OK, but can we go to the stationary cupboard?
Of course. Let's go.
Yeah right.
Let's have your shirt and tie please.
Now your shoes, socks and skirt.
Alright, you can see I don't have anything. Can I go?
No Nina. I know young women like to hide things in their underwear.
I would be failing in my job not to check those too.
Really though, sir, you can see I don't have anything hidden in them.
Take them off, Nina. It would be a shame to have to give you a body search after all.
Fine, but I'm turing away.
I'm naked, you can see I'm not hiding anything. Can I have my clothes back now, please?
Don't worry I wont take your light from you.
OK then.
Alight Nina, good girl. You've got no drugs on your person.
You can get dressed and go now.
Yes sir.
Sorry, Nina, but you do need to show me everything.
You already took my grandfathers lighter. What else fo you want from me?
Alight Nina, good girl. You've got no drugs on your person.
You can get dressed and go now.
Yes sir.
As you were, Nina. I'll see you in class.
Good morning girls.
Good morning, Mr [surname].
Doing a spot of football practice?
Yes sir.
I hope you two aren't planning any more tricks?
No sir.
And you, Louise?
