Bastard!
More rudeness. I'm going to keep spanking you until you apologise so you're better off doing it sooner rather than later.
Ow!
A crowd is starting to gather. Soon the whole school will be here to watch.
Alright, alright I'm sorry!
Good girl, Donna. That wasn't so hard now was it.
Now to give your bottom a little rub to help the lesson sink in.
Stop groping me!
Until you learn a little respect you'd better get used to being spanked and fondled, young lady.
There will be much more of this in store for you soon.
Alright, that's enough for now. You can go to class.
Grrrr.
See you later Donna.
I'll let you off with a warning this time Donna, next time I'll give you a spanking for that kind of rudeness.
Whatever.
Allowing girl to show you disrespect is bad for discipline. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} -1.
Are you carrying anything on your person you shouldn't be, Donna?
No. Of course not.
For your sake, I hope that's true. I'm going to check you for contraband now.
Tuck your skirt into your waistband. Turn around and put your hands on the lockers.
Why?!
Because you may be carrying drugs.
I would never do such a thing! I am a woman of class and status.
In my experience, rich girls party just as hard as anyone else. More so, if anything.
You are not talking your way out of this Donna so you may as well turn around and get it over with.
Unbelievable.
Now let me see.
Nothing in your socks or shoes.
Nothing in your knickers.
Ah! What the hell do you think you are doing?!
Checking your underwear, of course. A body search is no good if I leave any areas unexamined.
There's nothing in my knickers. Surely you can tell that just by looking?
I'm just doing my job Donna.
Let's check your shirt too.
Unhand my bosom, you filthy man.
Just checking your bra.
Hmmm... There does seem to be something under here.
Stop, those are my... My nipples.
They feel like two hard little bullets. Are you enjoying being touched, Donna?
No, I'm not!
Your erect nipples say otherwise.
Have you had your fun yet? Will you let me go now?
Yes Donna. You're not carrying anything illicit.
Of course I wasn't.
Despite her words to the contrary, I think Donna did enjoy being touched.
Turn around. Skirt up.
Why?! What now.
Hey, let go of me!
Ow! What the hell?! I didn't do anything wrong.
I know. This is just a little spanking to make sure you keep behaving.
