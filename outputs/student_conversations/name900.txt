Let's start with your shoes and socks.
OK, nothing here.
I see you like to shave off your public hair, Louise. Why is that?
I just like it that way. Not that it's any of your business.
Well, it's one more way to tell you two apart, I suppose.
OK, let's check the rest of your clothes.
Mary, you don't seem to be hiding anything.
Louise, you aren't hiding anything either.
Or course not!
Alright girls, you're not carrying anything. You can pull your shorts up and go now.
Yes sir.
Mary is quite a compliant, young lady. The complete opposite of her headstrong, troublemaker of a sister.
Let's hope Louise can learn to let go her anger and her need to get back at those she feels have wronged her.
Still no sign of any drugs. I must continue the search.
Speak to you later girls.
Hello Lucy. How are you this afternoon?
I'm good thank you, sir.
Hi Lucy.
Hi Rachel. Love the ears.
Thanks!
Hi Lucy.
Hi Rachel.
I am looking forward to your visit tomorrow morning.
I am as well, Mr [surname]. I've started to quite enjoy working for you.
Thanks again for saving me from that bee the other day. I was so scared.
That's OK, Lucy. All in a day's work.
Did you, um...
Yes?
Did you like what you saw?
I did.
Well, I was thinking, If you pay me extra tomorrow maybe I might let you see me like that again.
Oh really? Well then, I shall look forward to your visit even more then.
What are you talking about?
It's nothing, Rachel.
Is it OK, if I speak with the headmaster alone for a second please, Rachel?
Um....
It's OK rachel, just give us a second.
OK, I guess.
Sir, I was wondering if tomorrow you wanted to watch me changing again?
Would you like that, Lucy?
Yes.
I'd never done anything like that before. My heart was beating so fast I thought I might pass out.
I enjoyed it as well. You are a beautiful young woman.
Thank you, sir. You'll not tell anyone else about it though, will you?
I don't want the other girls to know I gave you a striptease for money.
Don't worry, it'll be our secret.
Ok then.
What secret?!
It's nothing, Rachel. You shouldn't pry into other people's business.
Hmmmmm...
