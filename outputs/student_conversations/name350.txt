Liz clearly enjoys being exposed. I must be sure to watch out for her sun bathing again at the weekend. Perhaps she might be looking for an excuse to be seen naked by me.
Well done you have earned your first point of Horniness. Horniness is not like the other statistics. There will be a limited number available and they will be more difficult to find.
Horniness will impact on the behaviour of the girls. However, in Version 0.3 there are only two points available and they won't have any effect yet.
I should punish you for your deviance young lady. However, you technically aren't breaking the rules so I will let you off for now.
Run along now Liz.
Yes sir.
See you later Liz.
Bye sir.

Good morning Charlotte.
Good morning sir.
How are you this morning?
I'm good.
I've been meaning to ask you, what's an American girl doing on this side of the pond?
Oh well, I was born in this country but my parents moved to the US when I was young.
After my parents got divorced my mom and I moved back here.
I see, and how did you end up at this school?
Well shortly after we moved here I had to take my exams.
I failed them because I'd been studying a completely different syllabus.
I mean, I learned pounds and ounces and now it's all, like, kilos and grams.
The next thing I know some men came to our house and told me I have to come to this school or I'll be shipped off to the army.
They made my mom sign a load of paperwork and now here I am.
It's really not fair!
Hmmm... sounds tough. Well, study hard and hopefully you'll be able to graduate soon.
I hope so sir! All I want is to get a job and earn enough money to get back to America.
Well, good luck with that Charlotte.
Oh and just one more thing.
Yes sir?
Lift your skirt and show me your underwear.
What really?! I saw that was a new rule but I didn't think we'd really have to lift our skirts for the male teachers.
Rules are rules Charlotte. Skirt up please, I don't have all day.
Yes sir.
Good girl. Now let's have a closer look.
Hmmm... there is a little red bow but I'll let that slide for now.
OK young lady you can lower your skirt now and run along to lessons.
See you later Charlotte.

Good morning sir. Is there something I can help you with?
Yes, lift your skirt and show me your underwear.
