Girls, I'm performing searches of girls looking for contraband.
Stand up and lift your skirts and open up your shirts.
Oh but sir, we're trying to get some work done.
Something to hide Maxine? Do I need to give you a more through seach in my office?
No sir.
Good, now lift those skirts and keep those shirts open.
Tuck yor shirts into your waistbands please and put your hands on your heads.
Now hold still girls until I've finished searching all of you.

Whilst patrolling the school you come across Amy and Alice wearing nothing but tiny bikinis.
Good morning girls
Good afternoon girls.
Alice and Amy you can't walk around school grounds looking like that?!
It's the weekend, we can wear whatever we like!
You'll give the school a bad name. Now go and change immediately!
What? That's so unfair.
The girls head off to change. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +2 {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} -2.
Hi girls. Looking good.
You like our outfits sir?
They look a little skimpy but I guess you can wear whatever you like on the weekend.
Thanks sir. See you around.
The girls appreciate you not telling them what to do. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +2 {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} -2.
Whilst patrolling the grounds you encounter Cassandra and Debbie playing loud music.
I think we should turn it down Cassandra, some girls might be studying.
So fucking what?
Hey you two.
Hey sir. Is the music too loud? Should we turn it down?
Cool, thanks Mr [surname].
The girls expected you to tell them to turn it down. They are surprised when you do not. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +2 {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} -2.
Sure thing, Mr [surname].
Oh, give me a break.

Whilst patrolling the school's grounds you encounter a group of girls playing in the sprinklers to cool off.
Running around on the freshly watered grass is a good way to kill it. I should really put a stop to this behaviour. Although, perhaps I can be lenient given the extreme heat.
You decide to let the girls frolic in the cool sprinkler water despite the signs saying to keep off the grass.
The girls really appreciate you not intervening ({color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +2) but ignoring such flagrant rule breaking is bad for {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color}.
Girls! What does that sign say? You're ruining Jimmy's perfectly tended lawn.
We're sorry, sir. We were just really hot and the water looked so cool and refreshing.
I understand, Lucy, so I won't punish you this time. Just try not to damage the grass in the future.
Yes sir.
The girls reluctantly agreed to stop playing on the grass and discipline is maintained. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +2.
Girls! What does that sign say? You're ruining Jimmy's perfectly tended lawn.
We're sorry, sir. We were just really hot and the water looked so cool and refreshing.
Being hot is no excuse for breaking the rules. Each of you bend over, I'm going to have to give each of you a few swats to your backsides.
Really sir? But we were only playing on the grass.
Rules are rules, girls. Now turn around and bend over.
Alright girls, let that be a lesson to you.
You gave each of the three girls a quick spanking and sent them on their way.
The girls learnt the importance of respecting school property. However, they all felt that punishing them for enjoying cold sprinklers on a hot day was a little unfair. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +4. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} -2.
