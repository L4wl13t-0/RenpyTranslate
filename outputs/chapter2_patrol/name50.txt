Patrolling the school ground in the stifling heat you come across three girls lounging around with their shirts untucked and no ties on.
It looks as if they've taken off their bras too.
Charlotte, Harriet and Alice. Do you think that is an appropriate way to wear your uniforms?
Oh but sir, it's way too hot! Can't we just cool off like this for a bit?
It is extremely hot today. I suppose I can make an exception.
Thank you so much, sir, we really appreciate it.
You decide to let the girls remain as they are. They are very grateful, {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +1. However, allowing such a blatant disregard for the uniform policy undermines your authority, {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} -1.
I won't make exceptions from the school's uniform policy's. Why don't you head inside and drink a cold drink if you are over-heated.
Aw, so unfair.
The girl's reluctantly get dressed and head back inside to cool down. Taking such a hard line on the uniform policy is good for Discipline ({color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +2) but it is very unpopular with the girls ({color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} -1).
Not enough {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color}.
If you girls cannot wear your shirts correctly them you shouldn't be allowed to wear them at all. Hand them over.
Hand over our shirts?!
You heard me.
OK, I guess. At least we'll be cooler this way.
The girls remove their shirts and learn the price of disregarding the uniform policy. However, they are secretly relieved to be wearing less clothes in the oppressive heat. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} + 3.
Patrolling the school ground in the stifling heat you come across three girls lounging around topless.
Charlotte, Harriet and Alice. What do you think you are doing?
Well, we're really hot and wanted to untuck our shirts. We figured that we'd save you the trouble of confiscating our tops and just take them off.
Hmmmm...
You think you are being clever do you? It's a nice try but I won't allow you to get around the uniform policy so easily. Get dressed and go head inside where it's cooler.
What?! How come you can tell us to be topless but we can't just take our tops off ourselves. You're no fun.
The girl's reluctantly get dressed and head back inside to cool down. Taking such a hard line on the uniform policy is good for Discipline ({color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +2) but it is very unpopular with the girls ({color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} -2).
Well, I guess you've outwitted me this time girls. I can't punish you by making you take your shirts off if you're already topless.
I guess I'll just have to leave you to it. Just make sure to wear lot of sun screen.
Thanks, sir! You're the best.
The girls think you are really cool for letting them hangout topless. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +2.
Patrolling the school grounds you find a group of girls having a study session under the shade of a tree.
How's it going girls?
It's OK headmaster, we are trying to do our homework but it's just so hot, its hard to focus.
I'm sorry about the heat girls, there is not much I can do about that.
No problem sir, see you later.
You leave the girls to their study session. They get some of their work done but were too hot to really concentrate. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +1.
How about I go grab you girls some ice lollies. Give me a few minutes, I'll be right back.
Oh wow! Thanks headmaster!
Grab 'em quickly, before they melt.
Mmmmmm... So tasty.
Mmmmmmmm....
Wow Faye, you really love sucking lollies, huh?
Mmmmmhhhmmm...
Oh no! Mines about to drip on me! Somebody help!
I'll save you, Priti!
Let my lick this side before it drips.
OK Emily, you lick the base and I'll lick the tip.
Never have I wished to be an iced confectionery more than I do right now.
Thanks so much headmaster, I feel much cooler now. I think we'll be able to concentrate on our work.
You leave the girls to finish their study session. They get lots of work done and they were really grateful for the cold treats. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +2, {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +2.
Good morning, Mr [surname]. Can I stop you for a moment to talk about an important issue?
Hello Maxine. What can I do for you?
I'm collecting money on behalf of an animal charity to help save the naked mole rat.
