The naked mole rat?
Yes sir. They are a hairless subterranean rodent from Africa.
They are mammals but they live in colonies with workers and a queen similar to ants and they are cold blooded like reptiles.
They were common until recently but due to climate change they are about to go extinct.
Do you want to see what they look like?
Here.
Essh! Good God, that is a hideous creature! You're raising money for these things?!
I think I can imagine what they might look like and I've no desire to see one.
Just because they're ugly doesn't mean we shouldn't save them. People only ever give money to save the cute and fluffy animals.
That's why China is completely overrun by pandas but no one is doing anything to save the mole rat.
Yes, China's panda problem has gotten out of hand.
I was wondering if you might be willing to make a large donation on behalf of the school? None of the students have any money.
Whilst the plight of these creatures is truly tragic Maxine, I'm afraid the school's budget is a little tight.
Here's 20 credits though.
Thank you, sir! Every little helps.
If you really want to raise some money perhaps you should organise a charity fundraiser of some kind.
A fundraiser?! But who would we raise money from?
Hmmm... A good question. The school's owners are very wealthy and they might be interested in donating, for the right incentive.
Let me think on this Maxine and I'll get back to you.
Ok sir. Please do. We need to act fast to save these fascinating and misunderstood creatures!
Uh huh. Speak to you later Maxine.
Maxine was grateful for the donation. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +1.
Walking around the school grounds you encounter Maxine collecting money for charity.
Hello sir, would you be willing to donate some money to help save the mole rat?
100 credits! Wow sir, that's super generous of you. I'll be sure to tell all the other girls how much you care about animals.
Maxine tells all the girls what a generous man you are and how much you care about animals. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +2.
Thanks sir, that's a generous donation. I really appreciate it.

OK, no problem. I guess you don't care about animals. That's totally fine.
The girls think you are a heartless monster for not donating to help an endangered animal. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} -1.
It's a windy day outside but the girls no longer seem to care that their skirts are being blown up.
The girls notice you creepily staring at them and they instinctively want to cover themselves. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} - 2.
Good morning, girls. Isn't this breeze refreshing?
Good afternoon, girls. Isn't this breeze refreshing?
Your cheerful greeting puts the girls at ease and they wave back unconcerned about the wind blowing up their skirts. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +2
A girl is sat quietly doing her homework. It's nice to see that she is no longer upset. 
You carry on patrolling the the school grounds but nothing interesting happens.
You sit with the girl and help her with her homework.
She is grateful for the assistance. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +1. {color=#51ae69}Grades{/color} +1.
Hi girls, what are you up to?
Hello headmaster. We're working on a project Miss Chang set us.
Fantastic. It's good to see you girls working hard.
Would you like any help?
Yes please, sir.

Well since there are so many of you in the same place it will be a good time to perform a uniform inspection.
Stand up and lift your skirts. Let's have your shirts open this time too.
Oh but sir, we're trying to get some work done.
Sorry girls but discipline must be maintained.
Now lift those skirts and keep those shirts open until I have a chance to inspect your underwear.
