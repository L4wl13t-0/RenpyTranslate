Hello sir, the twins are waiting outside for punishment.
Excellent, send them in together please, Samantha.
Hello you two. Are you ready to be punished again for your bad behaviour today?
We barely did anything wrong.
You displayed a lax attitude towards the safety of yourselves and others. As far as I am concerned that is a very serious offence.
The sooner you learn to think through the potential consequences of your actions the sooner you will stop getting yourselves into trouble.
Really? Because I think you'd still find some bullshit excuse to punish us.
Not so, Louise. I would never punish girls who didn't deserve it.
Do you think I enjoy making you twin sisters come to my office and strip naked so I can spank the pair of you?
Yes.
Well, you're right. I do, but that's all the more reason for you to avoid getting in trouble isn't it?
Mary and Louise, I sentence you to...
A public punishment. I'm afraid you must be made an example of to the other girls.
Today you will be cleaning the school grounds.
In accordance with the schoolï¿½s rules, please strip down to your underwear. I will then write the schools initials on your chest with a non-permanent marker.
OK, now to write the schoolï¿½s initials on your chests.
There, perfect. Alright you two, run along now. I want you two to spend the evening cleaning the windows of the dorm rooms.
I don't want a single smudge on that glass.

In accordance with the school's rules, please change into these t-shirts emblazoned with the schoolï¿½s initials.
Fine, whatever.
Great now put on this these t-shirts.

There is a lot of litter down by the beach. I suggest you start there.
Yes sir.

Private punishment to be performed by myself and Miss Potts. She should be here any moment.
Knock knock
Hello Mr [surname], do you need my help with the twins again?
Yes Miss Potts, I will be spanking Mary. If you would please assist me by spanking Louise?
Yes, of course, sir.
Go ahead and strip to your underwear you two.
When are we going to get to punish Miss Potts?
Yeah, you promised.
Soon girls. Very soon.
Mary and Louise are still angry with Claire and that will prevent her punishments from having the full effect.
I need to arrange a suitable time and place for the twins to punish Mary. Perhaps on Wednesday after the school play.
I'll need to make sure we have a place we will not be disturbed. I should make sure they have access to all the necessary tools.
Please note, the twinsï¿½ storyline will continue in a later update.
OK, you two. Hands on your heads. Miss Potts, if you would please remove their underwear.
Yes sir.
How come we have to be naked still?
You two lost your rights to wear clothes when you stripped a teacher. Come on clothes off.
Indeed, I told you two you to get used to being seen naked. A special exception was made in the rules for you two, I see no reason why it does not apply permanently.
This isn't fair.
