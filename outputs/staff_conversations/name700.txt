True and there is another important lesson for you.
The embarrassment you are feeling is just as important as the spanking itself as a deterrent for bad behaviour.
We will study this effect in more detail in futures session but for now we must focus on the spanking itself.
Yes, I understand.
Now Claire before we begin do you wish to confess to any bad behaviour?
Umm... Well, I did end up buying a new pair of shoes to go with my handbag.
And let me guess, a new dress to go with the shoes?
Yes.
I see. Well in that case this punishment is well earned.
Claire from now until I tell you otherwise you are my student and I am your teacher.
Yes [cname].
Yes sir.
Yes sir. Sorry sir.
Better.
Now lift your skirt and bend over this table.
Lift my skirt?!
But of course. Tuck it into your waist band. We don't want it falling down and getting in the way do we?
Errm... OK.
Now bend over the table. Keep your back arched and put your feet apart.
Yes sir.
You are to keep your hands on the table and you are not to move them for any reason.
Do you understand?
Yes sir.
Very good. I will begin the spanking now.
I want you to remember this next time you are about to waste your money on clothes you do not need.
Yes sir. I will sir.
Ow!
My goodness!
Oh my.
I am going to pick up the pace now. Remember you are to keep your hands on the desk at all times.
Yes sir.
Sir..
Oh my goodness.
Hands on the desk! I did not give you permission to move them.
Oh but [cname]. I mean, sir. My breasts...
I gave you a direct order Claire. You must obey it.
Yes sir.
I will continue your spanking now.
OK Claire. You did well.
Stop. I did not give you permission to move yet. Put your hands back down.
Yes sir.
Now stand up. Hands on head.
Sir...
Stand up. Hands on your head!
Yes sir.
This is another important lesson for you Claire.
Am I to treat you differently simply because your breasts have become exposed?
Once you give an instruction to a student it must be obeyed.
If I say hands must remain on the table then they shall remain on the table.
If I say hands on your head then you shall put your hands on your head.
