Just who are the school's owners and how can they possibly have that much influence?
As I have said before they wish to remain anonymous.
However, you may consider them to be a consortium of very wealthy individuals.
Ones who are most concerned about improving the standards of behaviour at our schools.
Is there really nothing more you can tell me?
A word of warning [name]. I would advise you not to ask too many questions about the school's owners.
Yes, of course. I will respect their wish for anonymity.
Very wise.
Very wise indeed.
Goodbye [name], we shall speak again soon.
Hmmmm... I wish I knew about the school's owners. Why are they so secretive I wonder?
Anyway, I should check in on the science classroom. See how Miss Chang is getting on with her new equipment.
