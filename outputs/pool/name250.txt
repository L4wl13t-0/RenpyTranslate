No one got hurt this time Louise, but things could have turned out differently if you had slipped and fallen.
The two of you need to learn to grow up and start acting your age.
Neither of you are leaving here today until your demonstrated that you can move safely around by the pool.
You need to walk and down the length of the pool and I expect to see you moving slowly and carefully with your arms at your sides.
Can we get dressed first?! This is really embarrassing.
No. You should be feeling embarrassed, Louise. The memory of this shame might prevent you from repeating your mistakes in the future.
Clearly you are not ashamed of your childish behaviour, hopefully having you parade up and down naked will have that effect instead.
What really?!
Yes. Just think yourselves lucky there is no one else here to watch at the moment.
Now get to it. You're not getting your swimsuits back until I've seen that you know how to walk safely by the pool.
This is so unfair! I won't do it.
Let's just show him and we can go.
Mary! Don't let him see you're body.
He's seen everything already. What's the point in fighting it?
But Mary...
Come on we don't have a choice, letï¿½s just do it quickly before anyone else comes along to watch.
Damn it. Fine. You win this time headmaster.
We'll do it, sir.
Good girls.
Humiliating these two is clearly not enough to alter their behaviour. Pain and a lot of pleasure will be required as well.
For that, I'll need them in my office and I'll need the assistance of another teacher if I'm to pleasure them both at the same time.
Alright you two. That's enough for now.
Please sir, we're very sorry. Can we have our swimsuits back now?
OK yes, I've seen everything I wanted.
You can walk safely when you put your minds to it.
Let's always try to move safely around by the pool in future, OK? Now off you go and join the others.
Good afternoon girls. Today you are going to be swimming lengths of the pool. Try to swim as far as you can in the time available.
All the girls are good swimmers although Amy is exceptionally fast. Making the others seem slow by comparison.
Swimming is a great way to burn off energy and the girls soon exhaust themselves.
Tired girls cause less trouble and discipline is improved. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} + 2.
Good afternoon girls. Today I thought we'd have a little fun and do some supervised diving or jumping into the pool.
Don't go getting ideas about running and jumping without permission though. This is something that can be done under teacher supervision only.
You let the girls take turns jumping into the pool.
The girls tire themselves out a little and they have some fun at the same time. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +1, {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +1
Let them off with a warning
Punish them now
Punish them after school
