I want to see all you girls doing this properly. Breathe in hard enough to push their chests out.
Um...
It's alright Louise, it's not actually kissing it's just CPR practice, remember?
I guess you're right.
Plus it does make sense to practice just in case anything bad did ever happen to either of us.
That's true.
OK, here goes.
Mmmm...
Debbie, I don't think you're supposed to use your tongue.
Sorry, Miss, that just slipped out. Let me try again.
Mmmmm...
Debbie! Your hand!
Oh, sorry, sorry. It just seemed like a sensible place to hold on to you.
I'll get it right this time.
Mmmmm...
Good work, Debbie.
Don't forget to practice simulating chest compressions too, girls. Although, remember not to push down hard.
Oooh, gosh.
I think you just push down in the middle of my chest.
Yeah, right between your um... Boobs.
They're so big, there's not much space to aim for.
Can we just do the kissing part some more?
Yeah, OK.
Mmmmm...
You spent the lesson making the girls practice the kiss of life on each other over and over and over again until they had perfected their technique.
Although it was an unpleasant experience for some, on the whole they rather enjoyed themselves. Horniness +1.
You arrive at the pool and spot the twins coming out of the changing area.
Last one in the water is a rotten egg!
Eeeee!
I was in first.
No I was.
Hey you two. What did I say in the safety lesson about running and diving?
We're sorry Mr [surname].
We just jumped in the water, so what?
I'll let you off this time girls, but if I see you trying this again you'll be in big trouble.
Now let's get this lesson started.
The girls appreciate you being lenient with them but allowing such dangerous behaviour is bad for discipline. {color=#545dbd}Popularity{/color} +1 {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} -1.
I want the two of you to report to my office after school. We can discuss your lax attitude towards safety then.
Yes sir.
You continue your sports lesson uninterrupted. The girls swim lengths until they are exhausted. Tired girls cause less trouble. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +1.
Out of the water girls. I'm afraid I must make an example of you two.
With your hair wet, there is absolutely no way to tell you apart.
Fortunately., we've already found a solution to this problem.
Oh, come on.
No moles, you must be Louise.
Now let's check you.
But you know for certain I'm Mary you don't have to...
Eeek!
There. Now to punish you two for breaking the rules.
You were warned what would happen if you misbehave by the pool and it's the same thing as if you misbehaved in class.
