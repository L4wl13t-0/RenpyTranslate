Mary, I'll have you across my lap first.
The rest of you girls gather around and watch what happens when you break the pool safety rules.
Ouch!
Now girls, swimming lessons are supposed to be fun so I take no pleasure in having to stop the lesson to give out spankings.
However, the pool safety rules are there for a reason. They are for your own safety and you need to follow them.
Running and diving can be dangerous and you could end up hurting yourselves.
Of course I'm aware of the irony of hurting you to stop you from hurting yourselves but believe me, the pain of a spanked bottom is nothing compared a broken bone.
A bruised bottom will always heal quickly whereas a serious fracture can leave you permanently disabled.
Now what have you got to say for yourself, Mary?
I'm sorry Mr [surname].
Good. OK Mary, up you get. Let's have you across my lap now, Louise.
Ow!
Really the two of you keep behaving like children. You just can't take anything seriously even something as important as poolside safety.
It wasn't that big of a deal!
And you Louise can't help talking back, can you? You just have to have the last word.
At least your sister has the good grace to recognise she was in the wrong and apologise.
Alright, thatï¿½s enough for now.
Letï¿½s try and get this lesson started.
You continue with your lesson but given the interruption the girls don't spend as much time swimming and they are not as tired at the end of the lesson.
The girls learn the price of breaking the rules and discipline is increased. {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} +3
Follow me you two. The other girls will need to watch the next part of your punishment.
In accordance with the new school rule your punishment is to remove all clothing from above your waist for the remainder of the lesson.
Well, that's not so bad. We have to pull out swimsuits down anyway for spankings.
Yeah, this isn't as bad as being spanked.
The rules say to remove all clothing above the waist, not to just lower them. We can't have you pulling your tops back up whenever I'm not looking.
But sir, it's a one piece. It's all attached.
That is unfortunate, Mary, but the rules are clear. I'm afraid you'll need to hand over your swimsuits.
You can't really expect us to spend the lesson naked!
I'm afraid I can.
No way!
You're wasting everyone's time girls. The lesson can't start until you've complied with your punishment. Hurry up and strip.
No.
We all want to swim. Quit stalling. Just take it off quickly and get in the water.
Yeah, just strip, no big deal. We've all seen you naked already.
But wait, don't you realise what this means? He can use that rule to force any of us strip naked any time we have a swimming lesson.
Yes, I can. All the more reason for you girls to obey the poolside safety rules.
Mary, what are you doing?
Come on Louise. Let's just do it quickly and get in the water.
Good girl, Mary. Accepting your punishment shows you are willing to learn your lesson.
How about you, Louise? Last chance to comply willingly before this matter escalates into a more serious punishment.
So unfair. Fine, I'll do it.
Good. Now all of you girls can safely get in the water.
Your swimming lesson goes very smoothly without the interruption of a spanking. The girls are all extremely well behaved to avoid being stripped naked. Overall {color=#ba1f1f}Discipline{/color} increases significantly (+4).
Once the lesson ended two girls were still waiting in the water.
Can we have our swimsuits back now please?
I have them here, you can come to get them from me.
Can't you pass them to us?
No. Come here I want to have a little chat first.
OK girls, we need to have a little discussion about your lax attitude towards safety.
We were just mucking about. No one got hurt. We don't deserve this.
