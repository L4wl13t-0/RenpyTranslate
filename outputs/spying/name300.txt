Are you OK Rachel?
I'm fine. I'll just go too...
It's OK. You shower. I'll wait outside and make sure you have the room to yourself.
Thank you Donna. You're so nice.
Don't mention it. Oh and let me close the window for you.
I don't know who the hell keeps leaving this thing open.
Hmmm... it seems like young Rachel has some insecurities about her body.
She seems to go to some lengths to avoid being seen naked by the other girls.
Anyway, I don't think I'll get away with opening the window again this evening. I should move on.
I'll have to come back again tomorrow to make sure Rachel is doing her 'homework'.
I've already been to Debbie's room this evening.
Debbie doesn't appear to be in.
Let's see what Debbie is up to this evening.
She's just watching something on her laptop. I can't see what it is though. I should move on.
Cassandra is in Debbie's room again. Let's see how Cassandra is doing after her spanking.
Hopefully she's rethinking her bad attitude.
Why don't you sit down on the bed?
Nah. I'm, like, fine standing up.
Is your butt still sore from getting spanked?
Yeah. It's so ridiculous that they are allowed to spank us. Like, who came up with this stupid new law anyway?
Bunch of perverted old male politicians probably.
Men are all the same. The world would be better without them.
Yeah but isn't the Education Secretary a woman?
How the fuck should I know?
I'm pretty sure they are. And what about Miss Newman? She's the one who actually spanks us. Can you believe she just does whatever the headmaster says?
I know, right?
She pulled my skirt up in front of him!
That's nothing! He told her to pull my knickers down and she did it.
No way!
If the school inspector hadn't been there then they would've spanked me on my bare arse.
Did he make her grope you as well?
Yeah.
I bet you liked it.
Shut up! No I didn't!
Yeah right.
So anyway. Let's see your bruises.
What?! I'm not showing you my bum.
Come on! I showed you mine.
Yeah but you love getting your bum out. You get naked all the time.
No I don't!
Yeah you do. Isn't that why you got kicked out of your old school?
No! It was nothing like that!
Yeah right, that's not what I heard.
Don't change the subject! Come on, show me your butt!
No way Debbie.
Show me! It's only fair.
No.
If you won't show me then I'll just have to take a look for myself.
Err... what do you think you are doing?
No way. Get off me.
