Come on, just lower your shorts a bit.
Debbie, get off!
Whoa!
Let me see!
Debbie!
Ha! I've got you now.
Seriously Debbie, get off me!
Not yet. Let's take a look first.
Oh wow. They really did a number on you, huh?
Would you just look at that those big red cheeks!
Shut up. I don't have a big bum!
Yes you do and it's gorgeous.
I just want to grab it.
Ow! Debbie don't do that. It's sore.
I can't help myself.
Get off.
No.
Grrrr....
Whoa!
Ooofff.
I'm going Debbie. You always have to take things too far.
Cass wait!
Damn it.
Cass come back here!
Debbie's running off after Cassandra, time to move on.
Let's see what the twins are up to this evening.
I wonder whose room this is?
It's the twins. This must be one of their rooms.
Wow. It looks as if the Watts sisters are actually doing their homework this evening.
How's the homework going?
Yeah OK. It's pretty boring.
So have you studied for Mr Wilson's maths test?
Test?! What test?!
Don't tell me you've forgotten? I was studying really hard for it all week.
Forgotten what, I never heard about this?!
Mr Wilson's maths quiz. Our class had ours today yours will be tomorrow.
What?! I didn't realise. I was too busy studying for Mr [surname]'s history test.
History test?!
Yeah, we had ours today. Your class will probably be tomorrow.
What?!
Haven't you studied for it?!
No!
Oh my God Mary. We're both going to fail an exam!
What if we get expelled?! What if we have to go to the army?! We might get separated!
Calm down Louise, they won't expel us for failing one exam.
Who knows what will happen?!
Let's just swap answers. We'll both get a perfect score.
No. Mr [surname] said it wouldn't be the same questions so not to bother giving answers to the other class.
Aw crap.
What are we going to do?
