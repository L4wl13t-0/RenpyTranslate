Of course, come sit on the bed.
So are you OK?
I'm fine.
What happened to you?
Miss Newman spanked me in front of the headmaster.
What?! That's ridiculous, they can't do that!
He asked for my consent to be punished.
And you gave it?!
He said if I didn't let them spank me I'd be sent off to the army.
That I'd be used as entertainment for the soldiers.
That can't possibly be true!
That's what he said and I believed him. I mean, they took us to this school and we're not allowed to leave.
What's to stop them sending us off to the army?
This is so crazy.
Maxine, you're the student president. You need to speak to the headmaster and make him stop spanking the girls.
Yeah, Debbie and Cassandra told me the same thing.
How is your bottom Rachel?
It's really sore.
We bought some ointment. It should help.
Thanks.
Pull your pants down and let's put some on there.
Oh, um. I'll just do it later.
Don't be shy Rachel.
No really, I can put the ointment on myself when you're gone.
Don't be silly. Someone should take a look at it for you to make sure your not seriously hurt.
I guess.
Lay face down on the bed and pull your pants down.
OK.
Oh my god it's really red. Hold still a moment Rachel.
Click.
Did you just take a picture?!
Yes.
Why?!
This is important evidence! When we complain about our treatment here we'll need proof.
But I don't want you taking pictures of my bottom.
I'll keep your face out of shot.
Click
Stop it Maxine!
OK. I'm done now anyway.
Right let's put some ointment on there.
No really I...
Donna, wait stop...
Mmmm...
That feels nice actually.
This is good stuff, it's got Aloe Vera in it so it's very soothing.
Mmmm... Thanks Donna.
Don't mention it.
This is very relaxing, I'll just rest my eyes a moment...
I think she's fallen asleep. Poor thing.
I should look into getting some of that ointment. Might be useful to have in my office.
