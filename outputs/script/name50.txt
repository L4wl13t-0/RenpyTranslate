I don't have time to do any shopping right now. I should check back here tomorrow.

I should tell Miss Chang that I have ordered the equipment she was after.
{i}Hmmm... there are some deleted files here belonging to the old headmaster. Should I read through them?{/i}
{i}These appear to be journal entries. There are four here.{/i}

{i}These appear to be journal entries. There are four here.{/i}
{i}This Miss Chang sounds very interesting. I really must meet her and find out more about her background.{/i}
{i}Why was the old headmaster so afraid of her I wonder?{/i}
{i}Mr Mykock was right about the old headmaster. He was too soft.{/i}
{i}But I wonder what request Mr Mykock made to make him so angry.{/i}
{i}This is dated just days before the old headmaster died.{/i}
{i}Did Mr Mykock have the old headmaster killed?!{/i}
{i}I could be in danger myself. I should ask around the school, see if the staff know anything.{/i}
You have unlocked a new main quest. Ask the staff about the old headmaster.
{i}Hmmmm... this is the last entry before his death but it's password protected. What was the old man hiding?{/i}
Miss Chang admitted to spying on my computer. I bet she knows the old headmaster's password.
OK, time to enter the password and see what the old man was hiding.
So the old headmaster and Ruth were having an affair?!
Yuck, what a load of nauseating drivel.
Passionate love making... with Ruth?! I find that hard to imagine.
This was exactly the sort of thing I was looking for, even if it does make me want to vomit.
What does he mean dark organisation I wonder? Presumably he means Mr Mykock and the group he represents.
I would really like to know more about the school's owners but Mykock insisted that I don't ask too many questions.
I would prefer not to end up dead in the woods so any investigation would have to be extremely subtle.
Jimmy said he found the headmaster's body and that no one went up there to investigate.
Might be worth going up there to see if I can find any clues. I should ask Jimmy to show me the way.
My main objective for now though is to help the girls. To do that I need to be able to spank them.
With this information I should have enough leverage over Ruth to convince her to change her vote at the school board.
I should pay her another visit at the teachers' lounge.
{i}These seem to be the rules governing staff behaviour that Mr Mykock mentioned.{/i}
{i}I will need to convince the school board if I want to change these rules.{/i}

Miss Chang is teaching the girls science theory. The girls don't seem to be paying much attention.
Miss Potts is teaching the girls English literature. The girls look like they are paying attention.
I'll need to wait for one of the girls to misbehave so that Claire can demonstrate she has understood my lessons.
While I'm waiting I should focus on punishing Debbie and changing the school's rules.
Miss Potts is teaching the girls English literature. The girls are seriously misbehaving. Miss Potts could do with some pointers on maintaining discipline.
Miss Potts is teaching the girls English literature. The girls are mostly paying attention but there is room for improvement.

Mr Wilson is teaching maths. The girls are laughing at him and calling him names.
