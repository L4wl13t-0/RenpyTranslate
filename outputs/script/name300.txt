The ointment I ordered has arrived. I should have Miss Newman rub this into the girls' bottoms during their punishments.
This will be essential if I am to make progress with Rachel.
Great, it's the cat ears I ordered for Rachel.
I can now do some role play with the girl to help her overcome her body issues. I'll use these after I next punish her in my office.
Oh, it's the cane I ordered.
I hope I never have any need to use this. However, it will be good to have as a threat should any of the girls seriously misbehave.
It's the chastity underwear I ordered for Amy. This should stop the girl getting so much pleasure outside of my punishment sessions.
I should convince the school board to allow me to punish the girls myself before I try to make her wear these.
I should patrol the halls again and try to catch her misbehaving.
I don't have enough money.
I should tell Miss Chang that I have ordered the equipment she was after.
I don't have enough money.
The construction work on the pool will take a week to complete. I should stop by the sports centre tomorrow to check on the progress.
I don't have enough money.
I don't think I'll have any luck finding Amy's pictures online. I should keep an eye on my emails.
There's nothing I need to search for right now.
